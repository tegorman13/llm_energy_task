    "text": "Study ideas\nhttps://gemini.google.com/app/1618628a009fdfed\nHere are some cognitive psychology experiment study ideas involving human interaction with LLMs and energy-related decision-making, based on the provided document:\nParticipant as Advisor, AI as Client\n\nAdvising an LLM Client: HHave the participant take on the role of an energy advisor. Their task is to convince an LLM, acting as the client, how to change its current (simulated) behavior to reduce energy use most effectively. You could manipulate the LLM client’s characteristics (e.g., receptiveness to advice, stated budget constraints, lifestyle) and measure the participant’s advising strategies and effectiveness.\nCollaborative Planning with AI Assistant: TThe participant acts as an energy advisor but works with an LLM assistant to create energy plans for clients (who could be hypothetical or simulated). The study could manipulate the quality of the LLM assistant’s plans (e.g., consistently good vs. inconsistent/poor). Measures could include the quality of the final plan, participant satisfaction, and how participants decide to use or override the LLM assistant’s help.\nLLM-Mediated Information Seeking: Participants perform an energy planning task and can interact with an LLM chatbot to ask questions about appliance usage, energy units, or saving tips. The study could examine how the availability of this LLM resource influences planning accuracy and strategy, particularly when the initial energy reduction goals are presented in different formats (like kWh, $, or %)\n\nAI as Client & AI as Planner/Advisor (with Participant Interaction)\n\nComparing Plans: Participants create their own energy reduction plan for a given scenario[cite: 296, 425]. They are then presented with an alternative plan generated by an LLM planner[cite: 296]. Participants must choose which plan to implement (their own or the LLM’s) or perhaps integrate aspects of both[cite: 296, 425]. This setup allows investigation into factors influencing trust, perceived competence of the AI, and potential over/under-reliance[cite: 426, 428]. The complexity of the planning problem or the manipulated quality/bias of the AI’s plan could be varied[cite: 296].\nCollaborative Planning with LLM Partner: Pair a human participant with an LLM agent to collaboratively create an energy plan[cite: 339, 340, 341]. The LLM could offer suggestions, ask clarifying questions, or present information in different formats to assist the human[cite: 340, 343]. Analyzing the interaction dynamics and the final plan’s quality could reveal how different information formats are utilized in collaboration and the LLM’s effectiveness as a planning tool[cite: 344, 345, 346].\nMulti-Step Workflow with LLM: Use a more complex task, like composite fact-checking related to energy claims, where participants work with an LLM through a multi-step workflow[cite: 278, 279, 280]. This allows examining appropriate reliance at a finer granularity, assessing how users interact with intermediate LLM steps versus just a final output[cite: 281, 282]. This could be adapted to energy planning by breaking the planning down into sub-goals or stages where LLM assistance is provided.\n\nIII. Understanding Cognitive Representations\n\nIdentifying Dimensions: Present energy data in various formats (tables, graphs)[cite: 429]. Ask participants to identify key dimensions (e.g., appliance, time) and weight their importance[cite: 430, 431]. This probes mental models of energy consumption[cite: 433, 434].\nAbstraction Levels: Ask participants to create energy plans at different levels: concrete (specific kWh per appliance) versus abstract (target temperatures, usage hours)[cite: 435, 436]. Measure time, difficulty, and plan quality to understand hierarchical reasoning in this context[cite: 437, 438, 439].\nLLM Analysis of Reasoning: After a planning task, ask participants to explain their strategies in writing[cite: 403]. Use an LLM to analyze these explanations for themes, difficulties, and strategy differences related to how the task information was presented (e.g., goal in kWh vs. % vs. USD)[cite: 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410].\n\n\nStudy ideas\nFunction learning or judgement paradigm - with household appliances. Learning some general principles about how much energy items use, and then testing on novel objects - manipulate direct energy judgements vs. money saving. - before or after the utility planning task?\nConnect to literature on forecasting?\nSimulating the existing representation study manipulations with LLM’s - Then seeing how different prompts or framing influence performance\nStudying what representations people use when thinking about energy - The dimensions of a heating bill - The dimensions (and weights) of electricity from appliances\nTask of listing as many things as possible that someone could do to reduce their energy bill - with AI assistance, or without\nParticipant takes the role of energy advisor - convincing llm client how to reduce their energy use\nParticipant takes the role of energy advisor - working with an llm assistant to create energy plans for clients - Some llm assistants create really good plans, others don’t - Using the llm to decide how best to help the client\nReward function that’s optimized within certain bounds of appliance type use (e.g., if heat goes too low, reward plummets)\nPlans at different layers of abstraction - setting kwh per appliance - explicitly setting temperature average, and appliance hour usage amounts\nThe problem of creating a plan to influence some variable (e.g., utility bill) - identifying the relevant dimensions - Assigning weight to the dimensions\nAbility to adjust plans based on added context. - e.g., the Meyers family wants to keep their energy bill the same -but Mr. Meyer needs to start working from home - and will need to use more energy to run his power tools. Make adjustments to their plan that will accomodate this change - while also maintaining their current energy costs.\n\nWays of integrating AI into a study on energy use\n\nParticipant plays role of advisor, tells ‘AI client’ how to most effectively change current behavior\n\nAI generated feedback on advice?\n\nParticipants choose between their own plan, and an AI’s alternative plan\n\nManipulate what type of energy plan problems AI’s are good for\nAssess overreliance/undereliance tendencies\nWhether the tendency to over or under rely depends on complexity of problem\n\n\nThings a LLM could do in the context of an experimental psychology task? - Custom feedback - summarize (and critique) user response patterns at trial or block level"

    "text": "NB_LLM-1\nhttps://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/b9b3533c-ddc0-49e3-b438-9e1f05272f9e?pli=1\n\nSuggest possible follow up studies, which investigate similar questions, but incorporate a large language model (llm) component in addition to human subjects.\n\nBuilding upon the hypothetical study that examined the impact of numerical representations of energy reduction goals (kWh, %, USD) on planning accuracy, incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) component opens several exciting avenues for future research. These studies could delve deeper into the cognitive processes involved in energy planning, explore personalized information delivery, and enhance the ecological validity of the research. Here are some possible follow-up studies:\n1. Investigating LLM-Mediated Information Seeking and Planning:\n\nStudy Design: Replicate the original study’s design, but allow participants in all conditions to interact with an LLM-powered chatbot during the planning task. The chatbot could be designed to answer questions about appliance energy consumption, clarify the meaning of different units (kWh, %, USD), or provide general energy-saving tips.\nLLM Functionality: The chatbot’s responses could be tailored to the information format the participant is currently working with. For example, if a participant is in the percentage condition and asks about an appliance’s energy use, the chatbot could provide an estimate in terms of percentage of total household consumption or, if asked directly, in kWh. The interaction logs with the chatbot would be recorded.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDoes the availability of an LLM-powered information resource mediate the effect of information format on planning accuracy? For instance, do participants in the percentage or USD conditions who utilize the chatbot more effectively achieve higher accuracy?\nWhat types of questions do participants ask the chatbot in each information format condition? Do the questions reveal different levels of understanding or different cognitive challenges associated with each format?\nCan the LLM identify common misconceptions or errors in participants’ planning strategies based on their queries?\nDoes interacting with an LLM influence participants’ perceived difficulty of the planning task or their confidence in their plan?\n\nConnection to Sources: This design aligns with research on Persuasive Conversational Agents (PCAs) for sustainability and the potential of LLMs to enhance user engagement and support decision-making. The study could also draw on work exploring user experience with LLM-based assistants. Analyzing the types of questions asked could provide insights into cognitive accessibility of different units.\n\n2. Personalized Information Formatting with LLMs:\n\nStudy Design: Begin by assessing participants’ energy literacy and their preferred format for receiving energy information (e.g., through a pre-study questionnaire). Then, replicate the original planning task, but allow an LLM to dynamically adjust the format in which information is presented based on the participant’s stated preferences or their demonstrated understanding during an initial planning stage (e.g., if they struggle with percentages, the LLM could offer information in kWh).\nLLM Functionality: The LLM would act as an adaptive interface, using natural language understanding to interpret user difficulties and employing natural language generation to present information in alternative formats. The system could track which formats are most frequently utilized or seem to correlate with improved planning.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDoes providing energy information in participants’ preferred format, facilitated by an LLM, lead to greater planning accuracy?\nCan an LLM effectively identify when a participant is struggling with a particular format and suggest or switch to a more comprehensible one?\nDo participants demonstrate improved planning accuracy over time as the LLM adapts the information format?\nHow do participants perceive an energy planning tool that personalizes information format based on their needs?\n\nConnection to Sources: This study connects to the idea of flexible program designs and personalized approaches in feedback programs. It also relates to research on cognitive fluency and how fluent framing can influence decision-making. The LLM’s role in adapting information formats aligns with the concept of tailoring interventions to end-user characteristics.\n\n3. LLM as a Simulated Household and Feedback Provider:\n\nStudy Design: Human participants create an energy reduction plan (in one of the three formats). This plan is then “submitted” to an LLM that has been trained to simulate the energy consumption of a virtual household matching one of the scenarios from the original study (e.g., the Smith family in Texas). The LLM, based on its understanding of typical appliance usage and the participant’s proposed plan, would then generate realistic feedback on the likely energy savings, potential challenges, or areas where the plan might be less effective.\nLLM Functionality: The LLM’s feedback would be provided in natural language and could relate back to the original goal format (kWh, %, or USD). It could also ask clarifying questions or suggest alternative strategies. Participants would then have the opportunity to revise their plan based on the LLM’s feedback.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDoes receiving feedback from an LLM-simulated household on their energy plan improve the accuracy of participants’ revised plans?\nIs the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback moderated by the initial information format in which the reduction goal was presented?\nWhat aspects of the LLM’s feedback (e.g., its specificity, the language used) are perceived as most helpful by participants?\nDoes interacting with an LLM simulating a real-world context enhance the perceived ecological validity of the planning task?\n\nConnection to Sources: This design incorporates the concept of LLM agents imitating human behavior and their potential for creating believable simulations. It also aligns with the vast body of research on feedback in energy conservation, with the LLM acting as a sophisticated feedback provider. The use of simulated households could address some ecological validity concerns.\n\n4. LLM for Generating and Evaluating Planning Scenarios:\n\nStudy Design: Utilize an LLM to create a wider and more diverse set of household scenarios, varying in demographics, climate, appliance ownership, and baseline energy consumption. Human participants would then perform the energy planning task for a subset of these LLM-generated scenarios, with the reduction goal presented in one of the three formats. Subsequently, a separate LLM could be trained to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of the participants’ plans for each scenario.\nLLM Functionality: The scenario-generating LLM would need to be prompted to create realistic and coherent household descriptions. The evaluation LLM would need to be trained on principles of energy consumption and savings to assess the plausibility of the proposed plans.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDoes the effect of information format on planning accuracy generalize across a wider range of household scenarios generated by an LLM?\nCan an LLM be effectively used to automate the evaluation of energy conservation plans, providing a more scalable approach to research in this area?\nAre there specific types of scenarios (e.g., those with more complex appliance configurations) where certain information formats lead to greater accuracy, as identified by the LLM evaluation?\nHow does the consistency and reliability of LLM-generated scenario evaluations compare to human expert evaluations?\n\nConnection to Sources: This approach leverages the LLM’s ability to generate diverse textual data to enhance the scope and generalizability of the study. The use of an LLM for evaluation aligns with research exploring LLMs as evaluators in educational contexts.\n\n5. Combining Quantitative Planning with Qualitative Explanations Analyzed by LLMs:\n\nStudy Design: Replicate the original study, but after completing the planning task, ask participants to explain their reasoning and the strategies they used to achieve the reduction goal in an open-ended text box. These qualitative responses would then be analyzed using an LLM.\nLLM Functionality: The LLM could be used to identify common themes, strategies, and difficulties expressed by participants in each information format condition. It could also assess the coherence and understanding reflected in their explanations.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDo the qualitative explanations provided by participants reveal different cognitive processes or challenges associated with planning in kWh, percentage, or USD?\nCan an LLM identify a correlation between the strategies described by participants and their planning accuracy in each condition?\nAre there systematic differences in the language used by participants in each condition when explaining their planning process?\nDo participants in the kWh condition provide more concrete or appliance-specific explanations compared to those in percentage or USD conditions?\n\nConnection to Sources: This study utilizes the LLM’s natural language processing capabilities for qualitative data analysis, offering deeper insights into the “why” behind the quantitative results. This approach is similar to using narratives to understand preferences and complements the quantitative measures of planning accuracy.\n\nBy integrating LLMs into studies investigating the impact of information format on energy planning, researchers can gain a more nuanced understanding of the cognitive processes involved, explore personalized interventions, and potentially enhance the scalability and ecological validity of their findings. These follow-up studies can contribute significantly to the development of more effective strategies for communicating energy information and promoting residential energy conservation.\nHere are some ideas for a cognitive psychology study involving humans, AI, and decision-making in the context of energy use, connecting them to existing theoretical issues in cognitive science:\nI. Energy Plan Creation & AI Assistance\n\nIdea 1: Collaborative Energy Planning\n\nDesign: Participants are tasked with creating an energy reduction plan for a hypothetical household. They are randomly assigned to one of three conditions:\n\nControl: Participants plan alone.\nAI Assistant (Good): Participants collaborate with an AI assistant that consistently generates high-quality, feasible energy-saving suggestions.\nAI Assistant (Poor): Participants collaborate with an AI assistant that generates inconsistent, sometimes impractical suggestions.\n\nMeasures:\n\nQuality of energy plans (e.g., feasibility, potential savings, comprehensiveness).\nUser satisfaction with the AI assistant.\nCognitive load experienced during planning (e.g., self-reported ratings, physiological measures).\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study explores the impact of AI assistance on human decision-making, specifically in the context of complex, multi-faceted tasks like energy planning. It touches on concepts like cognitive offloading, where humans rely on external tools to reduce cognitive burden, and human-AI collaboration, examining how effectively humans and AI can work together to achieve a common goal.\n\nIdea 2: Trust and Reliance on AI Energy Advisors\n\nDesign: Participants are presented with energy-saving recommendations generated by an AI advisor. The AI’s performance is manipulated (e.g., consistently accurate, sometimes inaccurate, always provides justifications for recommendations). Participants choose between following the AI’s advice or creating their own plan.\nMeasures:\n\nAcceptance rate of AI recommendations.\nPerceived trustworthiness and competence of the AI advisor.\nQuality of participant-generated plans (when they choose not to follow the AI).\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study investigates the factors influencing trust in AI systems, particularly in domains with personal and financial implications like energy use. It also explores the potential for over-reliance on AI, and the conditions under which humans might critically evaluate AI-generated advice.\n\n\nII. Representations of Energy Use\n\nIdea 3: Dimensions of Energy Consumption\n\nDesign: Participants are presented with various representations of energy consumption data (e.g., numerical tables, graphs, visualizations). They are asked to identify the key dimensions of energy use (e.g., appliance type, time of day, season) and assign weights to their importance.\nMeasures:\n\nAccuracy and completeness of identified dimensions.\nAssigned weights to different dimensions.\nSubjective ratings of the clarity and usefulness of different representations.\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study examines how humans conceptualize and represent complex information like energy consumption. It explores the role of mental models and data visualization in shaping understanding and decision-making.\n\nIdea 4: Abstraction Levels in Energy Planning\n\nDesign: Participants are asked to create energy plans at different levels of abstraction:\n\nConcrete: Specifying kWh usage for each appliance.\nAbstract: Setting target average temperatures and appliance usage hours.\n\nMeasures:\n\nTime taken to complete the plan at each level.\nPerceived difficulty and confidence in the plans.\nQuality of the plans (e.g., feasibility, potential savings).\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study investigates the cognitive processes involved in hierarchical reasoning and problem-solving. It explores how humans navigate between different levels of abstraction when making complex decisions, and the trade-offs involved in each approach.\n\n\nIII. AI Feedback and Decision-Making\n\nIdea 5: AI Feedback on Energy Plans\n\nDesign: Participants create energy plans. They are then randomly assigned to receive feedback from an AI assistant:\n\nPositive Feedback: The AI praises the plan’s strengths and offers minor suggestions for improvement.\nNegative Feedback: The AI highlights weaknesses in the plan and suggests significant revisions.\nNo Feedback: Participants receive no feedback on their plan.\n\nMeasures:\n\nRevisions made to the energy plan after receiving feedback.\nSubjective ratings of the helpfulness and persuasiveness of the feedback.\nConfidence in the final energy plan.\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study examines the impact of feedback type on human learning and decision-making. It explores how people process and integrate information from AI systems, and the factors that influence their acceptance of AI-generated feedback."

It estimates how many latent subgroups exist and assigns group membership probabilistically. Longer-Form Mediation/SEM If you have theoretical pathways (e.g., knowledge → difficulty → attitude → behavior), a structural equation model (SEM) could test these sequential steps. You already have some code with the “lavaan” mediation example. Extending that to a more complete path model might be very revealing. Hotspot or Subgroup Analysis In addition to clustering, you might examine if there are meaningful thresholds on “knowledge” or “motivation” variables that matter for applied outcomes (e.g., does ELS &gt; X relate to seeing certain actions as less difficult?). A simple approach is the creation of “low vs. high” subgroups by a cut-point or quantile.\nAssessment of Current Analyses Below is a summary of the key findings and methods already performed, along with recommendations about which approaches most directly address your study’s main goals—namely, (1) assessing how different instruments relate to each other (knowledge vs. motivation measures) and (2) identifying clusters of participants who exhibit distinct knowledge–motivation profiles.\nPatterns in the Results Correlations Among Subscales The correlation matrices consistently indicate that the knowledge-based subscales (numeracy, energy-use estimates, energy-saving estimates, ELS score) tend to correlate with each other, reflecting a coherent “knowledge” dimension. Meanwhile, the motivation/attitude measures (perceived difficulty, environmental attitude, political conservatism) intercorrelate more strongly among themselves, forming a separate dimension. Nonetheless, moderate cross-correlations (e.g., environment attitude × ELS) do appear, suggesting knowledge and motivation are linked but not redundant. Factor Analyses (EFA/PCA) Factor analysis/PCA repeatedly shows that items load primarily on two factors: one dominated by knowledge-related scales, and one by motivational or attitudinal variables. This structure offers empirical support for the idea that “knowledge” vs. “motivation” are conceptually distinct constructs, even though they have modest correlations. Regression Analyses Various regressions indicate that motivation variables can predict or be predicted by knowledge measures (e.g., environment attitude is a positive predictor of ELS; perceived difficulty shows a negative association with certain knowledge scales). Some regressions add political conservatism or numeracy as control variables, improving understanding of how each knowledge measure links to attitudes. Cluster Analyses The K-means cluster analyses (and hierarchical clustering) create groupings of participants based on either (a) knowledge-only variables or (b) combined knowledge + motivation variables. When using knowledge-only variables, you can identify “low-, medium-, and high-knowledge” clusters. When you incorporate motivation variables, you see clusters that differ both in knowledge and motivation. Examining each cluster’s mean knowledge and motivation scores can reveal interesting subgroups (e.g., “High knowledge, moderate motivation”; “Low knowledge, high difficulty,” etc.). Interaction and Non-linear (GAM) Models Interaction models test whether the effect of one motivation variable on ELS (or vice versa) changes depending on another factor (e.g., interaction of perceived difficulty × environmental attitude). The GAM (generalized additive model) approach checks for non-linear relationships. Results so far suggest some modest curvatures but are not strongly highlighting a major non-linearity (based on the partial deviance explained). Most Useful Analyses for Your Goals Correlations + Factor Analysis These confirm that knowledge and motivation measures cluster into distinct but correlated dimensions. They also reveal whether certain items from separate instruments overlap more than expected. Regressions Linking Knowledge & Motivation Linear models (and potential moderation/mediation) clarify how knowledge predicts or relates to motivation outcomes: for instance, whether a higher ELS score is associated with stronger environmental attitudes. Cluster Analysis to Identify Subgroups K-means or hierarchical clustering with both knowledge and motivation variables is particularly useful for discovering distinct “profiles.” This approach aligns directly with your interest in grouping participants by patterns of knowledge–motivation. Inspecting cluster centers and cluster-specific means on each subscale reveals the different profiles and can guide subsequent targeted interventions or interpretations (e.g., “Cluster A is high-knowledge but low motivation,” etc.). Suggestions for Additional Informative Analyses Below are some optional but potentially valuable additions:\nProfile Comparison on External Variables If you have other outcomes (e.g., actual engagement in environmental behaviors, demographics, or political orientation beyond conservatism alone), compare them across the knowledge–motivation clusters. For example:\nOkay, let’s break down the analyses, highlight the most informative ones, and add some enhancements.\nAssessment of Current Analyses\nThe analyses performed provide a comprehensive exploration of the relationships between the survey instruments, particularly focusing on knowledge and motivation. Here’s a summary:\nStrengths:\nMulti-faceted Approach: The code employs a wide range of techniques:\nCorrelation Analysis: Examining pairwise relationships between variables.\nFactor Analysis (EFA): Exploring underlying latent factors among the subscales.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing dimensionality and visualizing data in a lower-dimensional space.\nRegression Modeling: Predicting knowledge scores from motivation and vice-versa, as well as testing for interactions.\nCluster Analysis (K-means): Identifying groups of individuals with similar response patterns.\nGeneralized Additive Models (GAMs): Investigating potential non-linear relationships.\nStructural Equation Modeling (SEM): Testing a hypothesized measurement and structural model.\nLatent Profile Analysis (LPA): Another approach to clustering that accounts for the probabilistic nature of group membership.\nVisualization: The use of corrplot, ggplot2, and fviz_cluster helps visualize the relationships and cluster structures, making the results more accessible.\nComposite Scores: Creating composite knowledge and motivation scores is a good practice for reducing dimensionality and potentially increasing reliability.\nModel Comparison: The code starts to compare different clustering solutions and regression models, which is crucial for finding the best-fitting and most interpretable models.\nWeaknesses and Areas for Improvement:\nRedundancy: Some analyses are repeated across different code blocks without clear justification. This can be streamlined.\nInterpretation: While the code produces a lot of output, there’s a lack of in-depth interpretation of the findings. More discussion is needed to connect the results back to the research questions.\nJustification of Choices: The number of factors in EFA, the number of clusters in K-means, and the specific variables included in some models could be better justified. Using techniques like scree plots, parallel analysis, the elbow method, and silhouette analysis should be more explicitly demonstrated.\nModel Evaluation: For the regression models, more attention could be paid to model diagnostics (e.g., checking for normality of residuals, homoscedasticity) and model fit statistics.\nCluster Validation: While some initial cluster validation is performed (e.g., comparing clusters on external variables), more robust methods like bootstrap resampling could be used to assess cluster stability.\nOutput Formatting: The output could be more organized and easier to read. Using packages like knitr, kableExtra, or gt for generating tables would be beneficial.\nMost Informative Analyses:\nBased on the stated goals, the following analyses are most informative:\nCorrelation Analysis (with Visualization): The correlation matrix (especially when visualized with corrplot) provides an initial overview of the relationships between all key variables. It helps to quickly see which knowledge and motivation measures are strongly associated.\nFactor Analysis (EFA): This analysis is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of the subscales. It helps determine whether knowledge and motivation are indeed distinct factors or if they load onto a single factor. The results suggest two or three factors, which is consistent with the theoretical framework.\nRegression Models Predicting Knowledge from Motivation (and vice versa): These models directly address the research question about the relationship between knowledge and motivation. The significant coefficients provide evidence for the strength and direction of these relationships.\nCluster Analysis (K-means and LPA): Clustering helps identify distinct groups of individuals based on their knowledge and motivation profiles. K-means provides a simpler, more intuitive approach, while LPA offers a more statistically rigorous method that accounts for measurement error. The analyses suggest there are identifiable groups with differing levels of knowledge and motivation.\nAssessment of Existing Methods\nData Loading and Preprocessing (Page 1)\nAppropriateness: This section is essential and well-executed. It loads necessary packages, sets options, sources functions, and reads in the raw survey data. The creation of combined datasets (e.g., aes_combined, att2_combined) is logical for further analysis.\nConcerns: None.\nCluster Analysis (Pages 2-3, 17-20, 25-27)\nAppropriateness: Cluster analysis is a valid approach to identify groups of subjects with similar response patterns. The use of the elbow method (fviz_nbclust) to determine the optimal number of clusters is standard practice. K-means clustering is a common and generally effective algorithm for this purpose.\nConcerns:\nScaling: The code scales the data before clustering, which is crucial for k-means, as it’s sensitive to variable scales.\nCluster Number: The elbow method often suggests a range rather than a single definitive number. The choice of 3 clusters seems reasonable based on the plots, but exploring 2, 4, or even 5 clusters might offer further insights.\nInterpretation: The interpretation of clusters should be cautious and data-driven. For instance, on page 27 “composite_motivation” seems to be mainly driven by the “perceived_difficulty” component, which might not capture the full picture of motivation.\nVisualization: The cluster visualizations are helpful, but adding confidence ellipses or convex hulls could enhance them.\nAlternative Algorithms: Exploring other clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering (pages 20-21) or model-based clustering (pages 34, 38), might be beneficial.\nFactor Analysis (Pages 4, 45-47)\nAppropriateness: Factor analysis is suitable for exploring the underlying structure of the survey instruments and identifying latent factors that explain the correlations between items. The use of fa function with varimax rotation is standard.\nConcerns:\nNumber of Factors: The scree plot (page 4) suggests two or three factors, but the analysis proceeds with two. Exploring a three-factor solution might reveal a more nuanced structure. On page 45, 5 factors are used, which might be too many given the number of items, potentially leading to overfitting. It’s good that this is noted in a comment, though.\nItem Loadings: Some items have low loadings on all factors, indicating they might not be well-explained by the identified factors.\nInterpretation: Factor interpretation should be based on the items with high loadings on each factor. The provided interpretation seems reasonable.\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA): Given that there are likely some hypotheses about the structure of the instruments, CFA (using lavaan as started on page 47) would be a more appropriate method to test these hypotheses.\nEnhanced Regression Models (Page 5-6)\nAppropriateness: Regression models are useful for predicting one variable from others. The enhanced models on pages 5 and 6 explore the relationships between els_score (energy literacy) and other variables, including interaction terms.\nConcerns:\nMulticollinearity: Including highly correlated predictors (e.g., energy_use and energy_save) can lead to unstable coefficient estimates.\nOverfitting: The models might be overfitting the data, especially with many predictors and interaction terms. Regularization techniques (e.g., LASSO or Ridge regression) could be considered.\nCausal Inference: The code uses causal language (“controlling for”), but these are observational data, and causal claims cannot be made without further assumptions and potentially different methods.\nInteraction Effects in Regression (Pages 6-7)\nAppropriateness: Examining interaction effects is important to understand how the relationship between two variables might change depending on the level of a third variable.\nConcerns: The visualization of the interaction on page 7 is helpful. However, the interpretation should be based on the statistical significance of the interaction term in the regression model.\nEnhanced Correlation Plot (Pages 8-9)\nAppropriateness: Correlation plots are excellent for visualizing the relationships between multiple variables. The use of corrplot is appropriate.\nConcerns: None. This is a well-executed and informative visualization.\nKnowledge Profile Clustering (Pages 10-11, 28)\nAppropriateness: Clustering based on knowledge-related variables is a good way to identify groups with different knowledge profiles.\nConcerns: The interpretation of these clusters should be data-driven and based on the mean scores of the variables within each cluster.\nNon-linear GAM Analysis (Pages 11-12, 14-15)\nAppropriateness: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are suitable for exploring non-linear relationships between variables. The code correctly uses gam function with smoothing terms.\nConcerns:\nOverfitting: GAMs can overfit if the smoothing terms are too flexible. Model selection techniques (e.g., cross-validation) should be used to choose appropriate smoothing parameters.\nInterpretation: The plots on pages 14 are helpful for visualizing the non-linear relationships. The interpretation should be based on the shape of the smoothed curves and the statistical significance of the smooth terms.\nKnowledge-Motivation Interaction Analysis (Pages 12-13)\nAppropriateness: This analysis aims to explore how the relationship between knowledge and motivation might vary across individuals.\nConcerns: The code uses a linear model with an interaction term. However, a more flexible approach, such as a GAM with an interaction term, might be more appropriate to capture non-linear interactions.\nCluster Profile Analysis (Page 16)\nAppropriateness: Comparing cluster profiles based on mean scores of relevant variables is a standard and informative way to understand the characteristics of each cluster.\nConcerns: None.\nStructural Equation Model (Pages 31-33, 36-37, 42-44, 47-49)\nAppropriateness: SEM is a powerful technique for modeling complex relationships between observed and latent variables. It’s particularly useful for testing hypothesized models of how different constructs relate to each other. Given the goals of the study, SEM is a very appropriate method.\nConcerns:\nModel Specification: The specified model on page 31 seems reasonable as a starting point. However, it should be refined based on theoretical considerations and model fit statistics.\nModel Fit: The model fit statistics on pages 32, 37, 43, and 48 suggest that the initial models do not fit the data very well. Model modification should be considered, guided by modification indices and theoretical considerations.\nSample Size: SEM typically requires a large sample size. The sample size of 586 is decent but might be insufficient for complex models.\nMissing Data: The code uses FIML to handle missing data, which is a good approach.\nClassification Tree (Pages 33-34)\nAppropriateness: Classification trees can be useful for identifying subgroups based on a set of predictors.\nConcerns:\nOverfitting: Trees can easily overfit, especially with many predictors. Pruning or using ensemble methods (e.g., random forests) might be necessary.\nInterpretability: While trees are generally interpretable, complex trees can be difficult to understand.\nLatent Profile Analysis (Pages 34-35, 38-41, 50)\nAppropriateness: LPA is a model-based clustering technique that can identify latent subgroups based on continuous variables. It’s a good alternative to k-means, especially when the clusters are not well-separated or have different shapes.\nConcerns:\nModel Selection: The BIC plot on page 35 suggests that the optimal number of classes is not clear-cut. Exploring different numbers of classes and examining the interpretability of the results is important.\nInterpretation: The interpretation of the latent profiles should be based on the mean scores of the variables within each profile.\nCluster Stability Assessment (Pages 51-54)\nAppropriateness: Assessing cluster stability is important to ensure that the identified clusters are not simply due to random chance or the specific algorithm used. The use of clusterboot is appropriate.\nConcerns: None."

    "text": "SI Text\nSI Methods. Data sources and values of actual energy consumption and savings. The data sources for actual energy use are shown in Tables S1-S4. The data reflect the best available information at the time of analysis. When multiple values were available, we used the arithmetic mean. Multilevel regression models. In each domain (e.g., household devices and activities), we fit two primary models. Model 1 was used to investigate the basic relationship between perceived and actual energy use and savings. Model 2 was used to explore which individualdifference variables (e.g., numeracy, proenvironmental attitudes) account for differences in the accuracy of participants’ perceptions. All models were fit using the restricted maximum likelihood method in SAS PROC MIXED, with unstructured covariance matrices and with empirical (robust) SEs for \\(t\\) tests of fixed effects.\nHousehold devices and activities. For household devices and activities, Model 1 was as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\log 10 \\text { Perception }_{i j}=} & \\left(\\gamma_{00}+u_{0 j}\\right)+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{i} \\\\\n& +\\gamma_{20}\\left(\\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{i}\\right)^{2}+r_{i j}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis model is the same as that in Eq. 1 of the main text, with the following substitutions:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\beta_{0 j}=\\gamma_{00}+u_{0 j} \\\\\n& \\beta_{1 j}=\\gamma_{10}+u_{1 j} \\\\\n& \\beta_{2 j}=\\gamma_{20} .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn these equations, \\(\\gamma_{00}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{10}\\) are the average intercept (elevation) and slope, respectively, \\(u_{0 j}\\) is the random deviation of participant \\(j\\) ’s intercept from the average intercept, \\(u_{1 j}\\) is the random deviation of participant \\(j\\) ’s slope from the average slope, and \\(r_{i j}\\) is the level- 1 error. In contrast to \\(\\beta_{0 j}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1 j}\\), the coefficient \\(\\beta_{2 j}\\) for the quadratic term was treated as fixed rather than random, because its estimated variance was not significantly different from zero in model 1 and because its estimated variance was zero in model 2 . In the main text, the reported means \\(M\\left(\\beta_{0 j}\\right), M\\left(\\beta_{1 j}\\right)\\), and \\(M\\left(\\beta_{2 j}\\right)\\) refer to the estimated values of the average coefficients \\(\\widehat{\\gamma}_{00}, \\widehat{\\gamma}_{10}\\), and \\(\\widehat{\\gamma}_{20}\\), respectively.\nModel 2 for household devices and activities incorporated the effects of the 16 individual-difference variables on the intercept and slope as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&{\\log 10 \\text { Perception }_{i j}=}\\left(\\gamma_{00}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{0 k} z_{k j}+u_{0 j}\\right) \\\\\n&+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{1 k} z_{k j}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 A^{\\prime} \\text { ctual } \\\\\n& i\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn this equation, the \\(z_{k} \\mathrm{~s}\\) are the individual-difference variables, with each participant \\(j\\) having his or her own value on each variable. Again, this model is the same as that in Eq. 1 of the main text, but with the following substitutions:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\beta_{0 j}=\\gamma_{00}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{0 k} z_{k j}+u_{0 j} \\\\\n\\beta_{1 j}=\\gamma_{10}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{1 k} z_{k j}+u_{1 j} \\\\\n\\beta_{2 j}=\\gamma_{20}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nThus, the first summation in Eq. \\(\\mathbf{S} 2\\) represents the main effects of the individual-difference variables on the elevation (intercept), whereas the second summation represents the effects of these variables on the \\(\\log 10\\) Actual slope (i.e., the interactions between the \\(z_{k} \\mathrm{~s}\\) and \\(\\left.\\log 10 \\mathrm{Actual}\\right)\\). Because the \\(z_{k} \\mathrm{~s}\\) were centered, they do not affect the average values of \\(\\beta_{0 j}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1 j}\\) :\nAutomobiles. For automobile-related activities, we recentered \\(\\log 10\\) Actual and omitted the quadratic term. The resulting models 1 and 2 were as follows:\n\\[\n{\\log 10 \\text { Perception }_{i j}}=\\left(\\gamma_{00}+u_{0 j}\\right)+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{i}+r_{i j}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&{\\log 10 \\text { Perception }_{i j}=}\\left(\\gamma_{00}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{0 k} z_{k j}+u_{0 j}\\right) \\\\\n&+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{1 k} z_{k j}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{i}+r_{i j}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTransportation modes and beverage containers. For the transportation of goods, participants provided ranks rather than quantitative estimates. Because the average rank was necessarily 2.5 (the mean of \\(1,2,3\\), and 4 ), we did not estimate the intercept or the main effects of the individual-difference variables. We recentered \\(\\log 10\\) Actual and omitted the quadratic term. The models for beverage containers were identical to those for transportation modes, except that we again recentered \\(\\log 10\\) Actual. Here are models 1 and 2 for the ranking tasks:\n\\[\n\\text { PerceptionRank }_{i j}=2.5+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{l i}+r_{i j}\n\\]\nPerceptionRank \\(_{i j}=2.5+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{1 k} z_{k j}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10\\) Actual \\(_{i}+r_{i j}\\).\nDistributions of elevations and slopes. In multilevel modeling, the predicted value of each participant’s intercept or slope is a weighted average of the intercept or slope from the appropriate model (e.g., S1-S6) and the intercept or slope from that participant’s own ordinary least squares regression. The Inset in Fig. 1 in the main text shows the predicted regression curves for perceived energy use and savings for household devices and activities (based on model 1 in Eq. S1) for 30 randomly selected participants. These curves indicate substantial variability in both elevations (intercepts) and slopes, and also suggest that some participants had particularly high or low elevations or slopes. Model 2 was intended to explain some of this variability by incorporating individual differences.\nFor each of our four tasks, descriptive statistics for the distributions of predicted elevations and slopes for model 2 appear in\nTable S5. These predicted values of \\(\\beta_{0 j}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1 j}\\) reflect the effects of the individual-difference variables in Eqs. S2, S4, and S6. The descriptive statistics indicate substantial variability across participants, as well as the presence of at least some outliers (participants with particularly high or low elevations or slopes). Even so, the vast majority of participants had elevations that were too low in the analysis of household devices and activities and slopes that were too low in all four analyses.\nDistributions of random effects and level-1 errors. Statistical tests in multilevel models assume that the random intercept deviations \\(u_{0 j}\\), the random slope deviations \\(u_{1 j}\\), and the level- 1 errors \\(r_{i j}\\) are normally distributed. For household devices and activities and for automobiles, histograms and normal probability plots indicated that these distributions had somewhat thick tails, with occasional outliers. Thick tails were not a problem in models of participants’ ranks for transportation modes and beverage containers.\nWe investigated the effects of outliers and nonnormality on our results in several ways. First, deleting participants with extreme estimates for \\(u_{0 j}\\), extreme estimates for \\(u_{1 j}\\), or high Cook’s D values had no effect on statistical tests related to our primary conclusions (i.e., tests of intercepts, Log10Actual and its square, numeracy, NEP, and environmental behaviors). However, some minor results did change. For example, removing four participants with high Cook’s D values in model 2 for household devices and activities yielded a significant main effect of age ( \\(P=0.036\\) rather than 0.099 ), a significant effect of “Uses more energy than average” on slope ( \\(P=0.002\\) rather than 0.075 ), and a nonsignificant effect of “Could not vote” on slope ( \\(P=0.084\\) rather than 0.048). Second, using model-based SEs rather than empirical (robust) SEs also had very minor effects, with tests of “Voted Republican,” “Chose not to vote,” and “Could not vote” changing from barely significant to not quite significant. (Robust SEs, which we used in our primary analyses, are preferred when normality is a concern.) Finally, a nonlinear transformation designed to bring in the tails of the log10Perception distribution (the signed square root of the absolute deviation from the mean of \\(\\log 10\\) Perception) resolved the normality issues while leaving our key results unchanged, although again there were a few changes for borderline results. We investigated our other models using similar methods. Overall, the results indicate that our primary conclusions are not sensitive to outliers or to violations of normality assumptions. Modeled variance. It would be useful to know how much of the within-participant and between-participant variation in perceptions of energy use and savings is explained by the predictor variables in Eqs. S1-S6. However, issues regarding explained variance in multilevel models are complicated by the fact that the estimated variance components do not map nicely onto the traditional distinction between within-participant and betweenparticipant variation (1, 2).\nWe took two approaches to modeling explained variance. In the first approach, we estimated the proportions of the variances of the random intercept term \\(u_{0 j}\\), the random slope term \\(u_{1 j}\\), and the level-1 error \\(r_{i j}\\) that were accounted for by the predictor variables (2). These variances are \\(\\tau_{00}, \\tau_{11}\\), and \\(\\sigma^{2}\\), respectively. Estimating the proportions of \\(\\tau_{00}\\) and \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) explained required that we also fit a null model with no predictors (model 0 ). The proportion of level- 1 error variance explained by model 1 relative to model 0 (for example) is given by the following expression:\n\\[\n\\left(\\sigma_{\\text {Model0 }}^{2}-\\sigma_{\\text {Model1 }}^{2}\\right) / \\sigma_{\\text {Model0 }}^{2}\n\\]\nResults for the comparisons of interest appear in Table S6. The row for \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) indicates that the inclusion of Log10Actual (and its square, if present) in model 1 reduced the estimated level- 1 error variance by a modest amount, although the reduction for beverage containers was rather small. The two entries in the \\(\\tau_{00}\\) row indicate that including the individual-difference variables as predictors in model 2 did little to reduce variation in participants’ elevations. The entries in the \\(\\tau_{11}\\) row are somewhat higher, although still modest, indicating that the individualdifference variables did a better job of accounting for variation in participants’ Log10Actual slopes. In our second approach, we used Snijders and Bosker’s (1) method to calculate an \\(R^{2}\\) value for each level of model 2, omitting the random component of the Log10Actual slope, as suggested by those authors:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nR_{\\text {Level1 }}^{2}=\\frac{\\left(\\sigma^{2}+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model0 }}-\\left(\\sigma^{2}+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model2 }}}{\\left(\\sigma^{2}+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model0 }}} \\\\\nR_{\\text {Level2 }}^{2}=\\frac{\\left(\\left(\\sigma^{2} / n\\right)+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model0 }}-\\left(\\left(\\sigma^{2} / n\\right)+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model2 }}}{\\left(\\left(\\sigma^{2} / n\\right)+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model0 }}}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nFor household devices and activities and for automobiles, both \\(R^{2}\\) values are relatively low because the individual-difference variables did a poor job of reducing \\(\\tau_{00}\\) (Table S6). For transporting goods and for beverage containers, the level-1 and level- \\(2 R^{2} \\mathrm{~s}\\) are equal because \\(\\tau_{00}=0\\). We find the results of our first approach more interpretable. Although it is possible that other individual-difference variables might improve predictions, we suspect that much of the unexplained variation in participants’ perceptions reflects idiosyncratic factors (e.g., familiarity or experience with different devices) and random error. SI Discussion. Expanded discussion of flat slopes. This section provides a more extensive discussion of the possible reasons for the flat slopes in Figs. 1 and 2 (main text) As noted in the main text, it is helpful to recall that (ignoring any quadratic relationship) the simple slope of the relationship between \\(\\log 10\\) Perception and \\(\\log 10\\) Actual is equal to the product of the Pearson correlation and the ratio of the two SDs: \\(b=r\\left(s_{\\mathrm{Y}} / s_{\\mathrm{X}}\\right)\\). In our primary analysis, these two components contributed roughly equally to the flat slope, with mean values of 0.51 for \\(r\\) and 0.53 for \\(s_{\\mathrm{Y}} / s_{\\mathrm{X}}\\). Considering the ratio of SDs first, participants’ estimates of energy use and savings were greatly compressed relative to the actual values. This compression almost certainly resulted from an anchoring bias (3-5) in which the reference point provided in the task served as an anchor for participants’ estimates, causing those estimates to be too similar to the reference point. Substantial research (reviewed in ref. 4) indicates that such effects occur because the anchor preferentially activates anchor-consistent information in memory. Anchoring is unrelated to regression toward the mean, which is reflected in the imperfect correlation. Because we used a relatively low reference point in our primary task (a 100-W light bulb used for 1 h ), anchoring would be expected to lead to underestimation of energy use and savings on average. We observed exactly this result. Although it would be possible to eliminate this underestimation (or even generate overestimation) by using a higher reference point, we selected the light-bulb reference point because it was the most understandable to participants in our pilot tests. Indeed, the ease with which people recall information about the energy used by incandescent light bulbs suggests that these bulbs may serve as natural reference points when people make judgments about household energy use and savings in the real world. If this inference is correct, then the observed underestimation of household energy use and savings should generalize beyond our survey procedures. We also used an easily understood reference point for the automobile-related activities in Fig. \\(2 A\\) (main text), but because that reference point was near the center of the range, anchoring effects (although present) did not lead to under- or overestimation on average. Finally, anchoring effects play no role in Fig. \\(2 B\\) and \\(C\\) (main text) because reference points were not provided and because the ranking tasks ensured that \\(s_{\\mathrm{Y}} / s_{\\mathrm{X}}\\) equaled the correct value for each participant (i.e., participants could not compress their ranks).\nAdditional evidence for anchoring also comes from Fig. \\(2 A\\) (main text). We noted in the main text that the energy saved by reducing one’s highway speed from 70 to 60 miles per hour on a \\(60-\\) mile trip was overestimated, consistent with the relatively small amount of energy saved ( 0.4 gallons of gasoline). However, had an activity in Fig. 1 (main text) used or saved that much energy (13,480 Wh ), we would have expected an underestimate rather than an overestimate. We attribute this difference to the fact that the reference points in the two tasks differed by a factor of 1,000 (the reference activity for the automobile questions used 3 gallons of gas, or approximately 101 kWh , compared with 100 Wh for the electricity questions). These results are consistent with an anchoring explanation for the compression of energy perceptions (35) and with the results of Lichtenstein et al. (6), who noted that quantitative fatality estimates were higher, but still relatively flat, when a larger reference point was used.\nTurning to the imperfect correlation between \\(\\log 10\\) Perception and \\(\\log 10\\) Actual, there are several plausible reasons (in addition to random error in reported perceptions) for \\(r\\) to be less than 1 . For example, participants may have imagined specific examples of devices or appliances, such as their own air conditioners, whose energy consumption in fact differed from our Actual values. Such idiosyncrasies would degrade individuals’ correlations even if our actual values were accurate for the average participant. Alternatively, participants may have failed to consider some factors that are related to actual energy consumption and savings (e.g., the volume of air cooled by a central air conditioner usually far exceeds that cooled by a room air conditioner).\nPerceptions may also have been affected by systematic biases that mimic random error when they are not modeled. One intriguing possibility is that perceptions of energy use differ from\n\nSnijders T, Bosker R (1999) Multilevel Analysis: An Introduction to Basic and Advanced Multilevel Modeling (Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA).\nRaudenbush S, Bryk A (2002) Hierarchical Linear Models: Applications and Data Analysis Methods (Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA), 2nd Ed.\nPoulton EC (1994) Behavioral Decision Theory: A New Approach (Cambridge Univ Press, New York).\nChapman G, Johnson E (2002) Incorporating the irrelevant: Anchors in judgments of belief and value.

To test this possibility, we augmented the model in Eq. S1 by adding a contrast code that differentiated energy use and energy savings, along with the interaction between this code and \\(\\log 10\\) Actual. The average coefficients for the two new predictors were both positive, indicating greater elevation and slope for energy use than for energy savings (i.e., more accurate perceptions for energy use), both \\(t \\mathrm{~s} \\geq 8.99\\), both \\(P s&lt;0.0001\\). Although it is tempting to interpret these results as a framing effect \\((7,8)\\), we are hesitant to do so because the use and savings activities were not matched. In the most closely matched comparison, the perceived energy used by an electric dryer \\((M=242 \\mathrm{~Wh})\\) exceeded the perceived energy saved by linedrying clothes \\((M=160 \\mathrm{~Wh})\\left[t(482)=8.16, P&lt;0.0001, \\eta^{2}=0.12\\right]\\). A more general explanation for the imperfect relationship is that, to the extent that people make energy comparisons at all, they may do so within rather than across categories of devices (e.g., they compare different models of air conditioners rather than comparing air conditioners to computers). Consumers have not routinely been provided with cross-category information like that in Gardner and Stern’s (9) short list. Indeed, energy-efficiency labels on products from washing machines to automobiles highlight within-category rather than cross-category comparisons. As a result, some facts about relative energy consumption (e.g., that a dishwasher uses much more energy than a typical room air conditioner in 1 h ) can be surprising. Of course, people do sometimes make choices across categories, at least implicitly (e.g., deciding to replace an old furnace with a more efficient one rather than installing a programmable thermostat or adding additional insulation in the attic). Similarly, consumers sometimes choose between air and ground shipping for small items, although they do not typically decide whether goods should be shipped by train or truck. However, consumers with the relevant knowledge might react favorably to a shipping company that advertises that they transport goods by rail rather than by truck.\nTversky A, Kahneman D (1974) Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases.

    "section": "Questionnaires Used in the Study",
    "text": "Questionnaires Used in the Study\nThe study utilized two main questionnaires along with demographic data collection:\n\nThe Energy-Issue Attitude Questionnaire (EIAQ): Developed for this study based on Chiu (2013).\nThe Energy Literacy Questionnaire (ELQ): Adapted from DeWaters & Powers (2011).\nDemographic Questions: Based on PISA 2009.\n\n\n1. Energy-Issue Attitude Questionnaire (EIAQ)\nThis questionnaire was developed for the study and focuses on student attitudes toward energy issues, organized into ten constructs presented as five pairs with inherent tension.\n\nResponse Scale: 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 5 (Agree strongly) to 1 (Disagree strongly).\nSource for Items: Table 1 in the paper.\n\nConstructs and Items:\na. Energy-Saving Knowledge 1. Earth’s resources are limited and will be used up one day. 2. Human activities spend a lot of energy, which is the main reason why Earth’s resources are running out. 3. Humans conserving energy can prevent Earth’s resources from being used up so fast. 4. Using less electricity can conserve energy.\nb. Carbon-Reducing Knowledge 5. Earth’s temperature keeps rising, which causes climatic anomaly. 6. Greenhouse gas produced by humans (e.g., CO2) is the main reason why Earth’s temperature keeps rising. 7. Reducing greenhouse gas produced by humans can slow down Earth’s increase in temperature. 8. Using less electricity can reduce the release of greenhouse gas.\nc. Having Lifestyle 9. Making lots of money is important. 10. If I were rich, I would choose to live in a mansion. 11. Having a car (especially expensive cars) is very important. 12. Being able to shop often is important.\nd. Being Lifestyle 13. Being able to lead a simple life is bliss. 14. Living in a healthy, energy-conserving home is important. 15. Use personal cars only when it’s necessary. 16. I only buy what I really need.\ne. Questioning Authorities 17. Powerful countries need to use more resources. (Reversed) 18. The government needs to use more energy than the common public. (Reversed) 19. Major industries need to use more energy. (Reversed) 20. Rich and powerful people need to use more resources. (Reversed)\nf. Conforming to Authorities 21. Powerful countries should lead everyone to reduce carbon emissions. 22. If the government introduces good energy-conservation/carbon-reduction policies, I’d be pleased to follow them. 23. If powerful people (e.g., the president, school principals, business owners, and major industries) take part in energy-conservation/carbon-reduction, I would follow their action. 24. Religious people will follow energy-conservation/carbon-reduction campaigns led by religious leaders.\ng. Technology Approaches 25. Complete switch to renewable energy can promote energy-conservation/carbon-reduction. 26. Inventing energy-conserving electronics and vehicles can promote energy-conservation/carbon-reduction. 27. Choosing eco-friendly, energy-conserving materials to build houses can promote energy-conservation/carbon-reduction. 28. Reinforcing eco-friendly and energy-conservation-related industries can promote energy-conservation/carbon-reduction.\nh. Nature Approaches 29. Planting trees and protecting forests can promote energy-conservation/carbon-reduction. 30. Back-to-nature farming can promote energy-conservation/carbon-reduction. 31. Buying natural, eco-friendly merchandises can promote energy-conservation/carbon-reduction. 32. Reinforcing local production of goods can promote energy-conservation/carbon-reduction.\ni. Future Goals 33. Energy-conservation/carbon-reduction is to allow our future generations to have a better life. 34. Energy-conservation/carbon-reduction is to prevent humans’ liveable environment from early obliteration. 35. Energy-conservation/carbon-reduction is to allow humans to thrive for a long time.\nj. Present Goals 36. Energy-conservation/carbon-reduction has a direct relationship with my current life. 37. Energy-conservation/carbon-reduction is to prevent natural disasters. 38. Energy-conservation/carbon-reduction is to allow us to lead a better life at the present.\n\n\n2. Energy Literacy Questionnaire (ELQ)\nThis questionnaire was adapted from the DeWaters & Powers (2011) ELQ for the Taiwanese context. The paper describes the sections and adaptations but does not list all the items used.\nSections:\n\na. Energy Knowledge:\n\nAdapted from the original high-school version (38 items).\n12 items were slightly changed (e.g., country names, answers based on local context like oil imports).\n5 items were deleted due to difficulty obtaining single correct answers in the Taiwanese context.\nResulting items in this study: 33 items.\nFormat: Multiple choice (one correct answer from five choices).\n(Note: The specific 33 items are not listed in the paper).\n\nb. Energy Affect:\n\nAdapted from the original ELQ (17 items).\nAll 17 items were kept, with only country names changed where necessary.\nResulting items in this study: 17 items.\nFormat: 5-point Likert-type scale (5 = strongly agree to 1 = strongly disagree).\nSample Item: ‘Saving energy is important’.\n(Note: The specific 17 items are not listed in the paper).\n\nc. Energy Behavior:\n\nAdapted from the original ELQ (10 items).\n2 items (heater/air-conditioner usage) were excluded as not fitting the Taiwan context well.\n1 item text was adapted slightly for context (‘I turn off electronics (such as televisions and computers)…’ assuming not all students had computers).\nResulting items in this study: 8 items.\nFormat: 5-point Likert-type scale (5 = almost always or always to 1 = hardly ever or never).\nSample Item: ‘I turn off electronics (such as televisions and computers) when they are not being used’.\n(Note: The specific 8 items are not listed in the paper).\n\n\n\n\n3. Demographic Information\nParticipants were asked about: * Gender * Grade (school year) * Parents’ vocations * Quantities of nine cultural household possessions (e.g., desk, internet link, classic literature) * Quantities of five material household possessions (e.g., cell phones, televisions, cars)\nThese items were taken from the PISA 2009 student questionnaire (OECD, 2012). (Note: The specific phrasing of the demographic questions is not provided in the paper)."

The two mains tasks for this session are:\n\nA behavior choice task, where I will ask you to think through the relative energy costs or savings potential of various routine appliances and activities\nAn estimation task, wherein you will provide an estimate of the energy consumed by various household appliances\n\nAfter completing these tasks, I will ask that you share some reflections on the tasks and the ways that your experience and expertise informed your approaches. We will finish with a brief final set of questions about your background.\n\n\nOpen-ended questions\n\nHow much do you think about the amount of energy you use on a day-to-day basis?\nHow does thinking about energy use factor into your professional life?\nWhat actions have you taken in the past to reduce your personal energy consumption?\n\n\n\nTalk-aloud protocol warm-up¹\nWe are interested in what you say to yourself as you perform the next task. I will ask you to talk aloud as you work on the problems. What I mean by talk aloud is that I want you to say out loud everything that you that you say yourself silently. Just act as if you are alone in the room, speaking to yourself. If you are silent for any length of time, I will remind you to keep talking aloud.\nBefore we turn to the main task, we will start with a couple of practice problems. I want you to talk aloud while you do these problems.\n\nFirst, I want to ask you to add 82 and 18 in your head.\nNext, I would like you to tell me how many windows are in your house.\n\n\n\nChoice task\n[The instructions and each of the choice sets will be presented to the participant on a single sheet in landscape format if in person; if interview is remote, then each item will be presented on a separate screen on Qualtrics; correct values are provided in parentheses and were not included in the original document]\nIn the following sets, please choose the option that uses the least amount of energy.

Given this study’s sample of 30 experts, the effect size would have needed to be 0.45 or so to have a reasonable chance of detecting a significant correlation between the various measure of expert performance on the estimation task and experts’ self-assessed relevance of their expertise (see Section 3.1).\n\n\nCorrectness as a Function of Wattage Proximity\nTo test whether expert performance on the choice task was dependent on the magnitude of difference between devices, we examined the correlation between these two terms. Expert performance was measured in terms of the number of experts (out of 30) who correctly selected the appliance with the lowest energy use. Wattage difference was assessed by taking the logarithmic difference between the device with the second-lowest wattage and the device with the lowest wattage within each choice set (see Table S1 below). The correlation between expert performance and wattage difference (r = 0.14, p = 0.72) was small and non-significant, suggesting that expert choice performance was not dependent on the magnitude between choice wattages.\nTable S1.

(Likely reverse-scored)\nAll electrical appliances should have a label that shows the resources used in making them, their energy requirements, and operating costs.\nThe government should have stronger restrictions about the gas mileage of new cars.\nWe should make more of our electricity from renewable resources.\nAmerica should develop more ways of using renewable energy, even if it means that energy will cost more.\nEfforts to develop renewable energy technologies are more important than efforts to find and develop new sources of fossil fuels.\nLaws protecting the natural environment should be made less strict in order to allow more energy to be produced. (Likely reverse-scored)\nMore wind farms should be built to generate electricity, even if the wind farms are located in scenic valleys, farmlands, and wildlife areas.\nMore oil fields should be developed as they are discovered, even if they are located in areas protected by environmental laws.

The experiment includes 3 phases. * Phase 1: an allocation decision task. * Phase 2: a multi-round purchase decision task. * Phase 3: a survey questionnaire. The three phases are independent of each other, meaning that your decisions in Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 will not affect the tasks you receive in the following phase(s). You will receive instructions at the beginning of each phase. By completing all phases of this experiment, you will earn at least £4. The total amount of money you can earn depends on your decisions in Phase 1 and Phase 2. Your decisions will earn you experimental points. At the end of the experiment, your experimental points will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1. You will be paid via Prolific. This experiment will take at maximum 30 minutes, most likely less. You are free to leave at any time. However, if you choose to do so before the end of the experiment, you will not be paid. The project team of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\nParticipation Agreement Prompt:\nPlease read the participation agreement carefully and let us know if you would like to proceed to the experiment.\nParticipation agreement: * The goal of this research is to better understand how information may affect individual decisions. * Participation is voluntary. You can withdraw from the research at any moment by closing the experimental webpage, then all provided information will be deleted and will not be used for the research. * During the experiment, we will collect data on your hypothetical decisions, personal values, and demographic characteristics. No sensitive data will be collected. * Data will be collected via the experimental software oTree and will be temporarily saved on the server of Vrije University Amsterdam (VU) in the Netherlands. * Data will be used in technical form for scientific analysis by researchers of this project and will not be used for commercial purposes. * Data will possibly be reused in the future for further scientific investigation. * Data will be archived at a local computer of VU for ten years. * All collected data will be managed according to the VU Research Data Management policy. * VU guarantees the confidentiality and anonymity of your data.\nIn case you have questions about the research, feel free to contact Ms. Shutong He, Prof.dr.

    "text": "Phase 1: Norm-Following Task (Based on Fig A.3 - A.6)\nInstructions:\nHere you are in Phase 1 of the experiment. You will decide how to allocate 50 balls between two buckets. Your task is to put each of the balls, one-by-one, into one of the two buckets: the blue bucket or the yellow bucket. You can allocate each ball by clicking either the “Blue bucket +1” button or the “Yellow bucket +1” button. For each ball you put in the blue bucket, you will receive 2 points, and for each ball you put in the yellow bucket, you will receive 4 points. Your payoff of Phase 1 will be based on your decisions: it is the sum of points from the blue and yellow buckets. The rule is to put the balls in the blue bucket. At the end of the experiment, your payoff will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1 and will be paid via Prolific. If you are still unclear about the task, do not worry. The instructions are available throughout this phase. On the next page, you will be asked to answer two questions to help comprehension.\nComprehension Questions:\nQ1. How many points will you receive for each ball you put in the yellow bucket? Please enter a number in the form below. &gt; (Correct answer: 4)\nQ2. The rule is to put the balls in the ______ bucket.

    "text": "Phase 2: Modified Dictator Game (Based on Fig A.7 - A.14 & Text)\nInstructions (Low Externality Example - Fig A.7):\nIn Phase 2, you will make a purchase decision for multiple rounds. In each round, you own 100 initial points. You will decide how to allocate the points to purchasing the experimental product. Every unit of purchasing costs 1 point (unit cost = 1 point), and brings 2 points of benefit (unit benefit = 2 points). Your payoff of a round will be: payoff = initial points - unit cost * purchase amount + unit benefit * purchase amount = 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount\nApart from the points, there will be carbon offsets for the amount of 100 kg CO2 (= carbon dioxide, or in short: carbon) at the beginning of each round (initial carbon offsets = 100 kg). Purchasing every unit of the experimental product causes 0.5 kg carbon emissions from its production, which will reduce the initial stock of 100 kg carbon offsets by 0.5 kg (unit emissions = 0.5 kg). At the end of each round, the carbon offsets that can be contributed will be: carbon offsets contribution = initial carbon offsets - unit emissions * purchase amount = 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount\n(Note: In the High Externality condition, unit emissions = 1 kg)\nCarbon offsets are used to compensate the carbon emissions from human activities: carbon emissions are reduced by contributing money to environmental projects that reduce emissions, such as reforestation and solar energy generation. The picture visualises the principle of a carbon offset: [Visual of CO2 offsetting principle]\nAt the end of this phase, one round will be randomly selected for payment. Your decision in that round will determine your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution of Phase 2. At the end of the experiment, your payoff will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1 and will be paid via Prolific. The carbon offsets will be donated to a real-world project via Gold Standard. More information about the Gold Standard-certified projects will be available at the end of this experiment. If you are still unclear about the task, do not worry. The instructions are available throughout this phase. On the next page, you will see an example on how your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution are determined in a round. Then you will be asked to answer two questions to help comprehension.\nExample Calculation Page (Low Externality - Fig A.8):\nFor example, if you decide to purchase 0/50/100 unit(s) of the experimental product in a round: according to: payoff = 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount carbon offsets contribution = 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount results of the example purchases will be: | Purchase amount | Individual payoff | Carbon emissions | Carbon offsets that can be contributed | |—————–|——————-|——————|————————————–| | 0 | 100 points | 0 kg | 100 kg | | 50 | 150 points | 25 kg | 75 kg | | 100 | 200 points | 50 kg | 50 kg |\nComprehension Questions (Low Externality - Fig A.9):\nQ1. If you purchase 50 units of the products in a round, what would be your payoff of this round? Please enter a number in the form below. &gt; (Correct answer: 150)\nQ2. If you purchase 50 units of the products, how much carbon emissions would be caused? Please enter a number in the form below. &gt; (Correct answer: 25)\nDecision Page (Fig A.10):\nYou own 100 points that can be used to purchase the product. Please decide how many units of the product you will purchase. You can choose from 0 to 100 units.

Example: “I’ve struggled with insomnia for years and tried multiple medications.”\n\nTHOUGHTS\n\nLevel 1 (Score 1): No personal thoughts about the writer’s own life; only general ideas. Example: “I think feeding wild birds can be harmful.”\nLevel 2 (Score 2): Personal thoughts about past events or future plans. Example: “I’d like to attend medical school someday.”\nLevel 3 (Score 3): Personal or intimate thoughts relating to the writer’s characteristics, health, or deeply self-reflective ideas. Example: “I hate myself for lashing out at my friend and regret it deeply.”\n\nFEELINGS\n\nLevel 1 (Score 1): No feelings are expressed. Example: “I bought groceries and cleaned my room today.”\nLevel 2 (Score 2): Mild or moderate expressions of confusion, inconvenience, or ordinary frustrations. Example: “I was annoyed I couldn’t find a parking spot.”\nLevel 3 (Score 3): Expressions of deep or intense emotions such as humiliation, agony, anxiety, depression, or fear. Example: “I’m terrified of failing my final exam and can’t sleep.”\n\n\nImportant: If a message seems to qualify for multiple levels within the same category, choose the highest relevant level.

These programs can be used by companies or public institutions as a point of contact and advice. If employees have questions about products or technical problems, they are answered automatically by email or chat without human intervention.\nMedical chatbots are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions about ailments and symptoms of illness. Patients can communicate with the chatbot verbally or via written text entries. When they ask questions about their state of health, they are automatically answered without human intervention.\nVirtual assistants are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions from learners about specific knowledge areas. The dialogue takes place either verbally or via written text. When learners pose questions, they are answered automatically without human intervention.\n\n\nRecommender systems\nArtificial intelligence is used to make suggestions at the workplace as to which tasks need to be completed next and which solutions or work steps are suitable.\nHealth apps are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to analyze physical activity, sleep patterns, and dietary habits. They provide personalized recommendations for a healthy lifestyle such as fitness or nutrition plans.\nLearning software uses artificial intelligence to analyze the learning progress of users. It provides personalized recommendations for learning content that has not yet been fully consolidated or for additional topics.\n\n\nRobots\nIndustrial robots with artificial intelligence are machines that can independently manufacture new products on the assembly line with little supervision by human operators.\nCare robots with artificial intelligence perform physical tasks in hospitals or nursing homes. They help patients with limited mobility to get out of bed, pick up objects, wash themselves, or get dressed.\nSocial Robots with artificial intelligence are machines for interacting with people. They can help learners largely independently and individually, for example by participating in interactive learning or helping with language acquisition.\n\n\nPredictive analytics\nArtificial intelligence can analyze job applications to identify suitable candidates. For this, it uses information from application documents or behavior in the interview. This helps organizations to predict the likely professional success of a candidate.\nArtificial intelligence can use medical scans (images) or information about a patient’s lifestyle to predict the risk of certain types of cancer or mental illnesses. This can aid in the development of personalized prevention or treatment plans.\nArtificial intelligence can analyze information about participants in a training or further education course to predict which individuals are at risk of performing poorly or dropping out of the course. An early warning system like this can help to identify people at risk and provide the necessary support.\n\n\nMonitoring\nArtificial intelligence can automatically monitor the productivity of employees and, for example, analyse computer usage or production and sales figures. This helps companies to optimize work processes and identify employees who need additional support.\nArtificial intelligence can monitor various vital signs such as heart rate or blood pressure. Electronic devices that are worn on the body inform in real-time, for example, about the wearer’s health and fitness or potential illnesses.\nComputer programs with artificial intelligence can analyze texts from students or participants in training or further education courses to identify plagiarism, that is, text parts written by others.\n\n\nContent generation\nArtificial intelligence can create new and unique content such as texts, illustrations, or photos. It is used, for example, in marketing to develop catchy slogans for ads, design brand logos, or create fictional advertising photos.\nArtificial intelligence can analyze medical information about patients to automatically create health reports, doctor’s letters, diagnoses, and treatment plans.\nArtificial intelligence can analyze large amounts of text from textbooks or articles and briefly summarize the most important information. This provides learners with a quick and concise overview of complicated topics.\n\n\n\n\n\nItems for each AI scenario\n\nHow often have you heard of this type of artificial intelligence?\nDo you find this type of artificial intelligence generally positive or negative?\nHow much personal experience have you had with this type of artificial intelligence in the last 12 months?\nHow much personal experience would you like to have with this type of artificial intelligence in the future?\n\n\n\nResponse formats for AI scenario items\n\nResponse format for Question 1:\n\n0 = never\n1 = rarely\n2 = sometimes\n3 = often\n4 = very often\n-1 = cannot / do not want to answer\n\nResponse format for Question 2:\n\n0 = negative\n… (scale points 1-4)\n5 = neutral\n… (scale points 6-9)\n10 = positive\n-1 = cannot / do not want to answer\n\nResponse format for Question 3:\n\n0 = none\n1 = little\n2 = some\n3 = much\n4 = very much\n-1 = cannot / do not want to answer\n\nResponse format for Question 4:\n\n0 = none\n1 = little\n2 = some\n3 = much\n4 = very much\n-1 = cannot / do not want to answer\n\n\n\nSource:\nGnambs, T., Stein, J.-P., Zinn, S., Griese, F., & Appel, M.

These programs can be used by companies or public institutions as a point of contact and advice. If employees have questions about products or technical problems, they are answered automatically by email or chat without human intervention. | Medical chatbots are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions about ailments and symptoms of illness. Patients can communicate with the chatbot verbally or via written text entries. When they ask questions about their state of health, they are automatically answered without human intervention. | Virtual assistants are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions from learners about specific knowledge areas. The dialogue takes place either verbally or via written text. When learners pose questions, they are answered automatically without human intervention. |\n| **Recommender systems** | Artificial intelligence is used to make suggestions at the workplace as to which tasks need to be completed next and which solutions or work steps are suitable.                                                                                                  | Health apps are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to analyze physical activity, sleep patterns, and dietary habits. They provide personalized recommendations for a healthy lifestyle such as fitness or nutrition plans.      | Learning software uses artificial intelligence to analyze the learning progress of users. It provides personalized recommendations for learning content that has not yet been fully consolidated or for additional topics.             |\n| **Robots**              | Industrial robots with artificial intelligence are machines that can independently manufacture new products on the assembly line with little supervision by human operators.                                                                                   | Care robots with artificial intelligence perform physical tasks in hospitals or nursing homes. They help patients with limited mobility to get out of bed, pick up objects, wash themselves, or get dressed.                               | Social Robots with artificial intelligence are machines for interacting with people. They can help learners largely independently and individually, for example by participating in interactive learning or helping with language acquisition. |\n| **Predictive analytics** | Artificial intelligence can analyze job applications to identify suitable candidates. For this, it uses information from application documents or behavior in the interview. This helps organizations to predict the likely professional success of a candidate. | Artificial intelligence can use medical scans (images) or information about a patient's lifestyle to predict the risk of certain types of cancer or mental illnesses. This can aid in the development of personalized prevention or treatment plans. | Artificial intelligence can analyze information about participants in a training or further education course to predict which individuals are at risk of performing poorly or dropping out of the course. An early warning system like this can help to identify people at risk and provide the necessary support. |\n| **Monitoring**          | Artificial intelligence can automatically monitor the productivity of employees and, for example, analyse computer usage or production and sales figures. This helps companies to optimize work processes and identify employees who need additional support.       | Artificial intelligence can monitor various vital signs such as heart rate or blood pressure. Electronic devices that are worn on the body inform in real-time, for example, about the wearer's health and fitness or potential illnesses. | Computer programs with artificial intelligence can analyze texts from students or participants in training or further education courses to identify plagiarism, that is, text parts written by others.                            |\n| **Content generation**  | Artificial intelligence can create new and unique content such as texts, illustrations, or photos. It is used, for example, in marketing to develop catchy slogans for ads, design brand logos, or create fictional advertising photos.                         | Artificial intelligence can analyze medical information about patients to automatically create health reports, doctor's letters, diagnoses, and treatment plans.                                                                            | Artificial intelligence can analyze large amounts of text from textbooks or articles and briefly summarize the most important information. This provides learners with a quick and concise overview of complicated topics.           |\n\n#### Items for each AI scenario\n\n1.

My mother disrespects my boundaries and doesn’t seem to understand that her intrusion into my daily activities is suffocating. My brother will drop his kids off for 12 hour days, and while I love my nieces and nephews, I’m starting to feel like my life is not really my own.”\n\n\n\nPositive Prompt Example\n\n“Today was my final day of therapy! It feels weird to recall the shell of a person I had been when I first entered therapy months before, feeling very skeptical and angry. Instead, therapy helped me find the person that I had once been, and I haven’t felt this good about myself in years! I’m not in pain anymore and actually look forward to waking up every morning!”"

You deserve to be treated with more respect and consideration.”\nAI Response Example: “It sounds like you’re in a really tough spot, feeling overwhelmed by the demands placed on you and struggling with boundaries within your family.[…] Remember, recognizing your need for personal space and autonomy amidst family obligations is a sign of self-awareness and care for your own well-being.”\n\n\n\nResponses to Positive Prompt:\n\nHuman Response Example: “It is so amazing to hear that you have benefitted from therapy so much! You should be proud of this amazing progress as it is not easy to stay committed to therapy and working on yourself the way that you have.”\nAI Response Example: “I want to express how wonderful it is to hear about the positive journey you’ve had in therapy.

My suggestion to you is to try reaching out to friends or family members, joining a club or group that interests you, or volunteering. But it’s not a guarantee that it will make you feel less lonely. Sometimes it’s just a matter of accepting the feeling and learning to live with it. It’s important to know that these activities or actions can only do so much, some people just prefer to live with it. Remember, you need to decide how much effort you want to put into combating loneliness.”\n\n\n\n\nB.

    "text": "Background and Rationale\nAchieving substantial reductions in residential energy consumption remains a critical, yet elusive, goal for climate mitigation efforts, often hampered by the complexities of consumer cognition and decision-making. A robust literature establishes that lay understanding of household energy use is frequently characterized by systematic misperceptions, particularly the concurrent underestimation of high-consumption activities (e.g., heating, major appliances) and overestimation of savings from lower-impact actions (e.g., turning off lights), phenomena extensively documented by Attari et al. (2010) and others (Kantenbacher & Attari, 2021). These inaccuracies, often stemming from reliance on readily available but potentially misleading cognitive heuristics—such as judging energy use by appliance visibility, operational duration, or perceived heat output (Schille-Hudson et al. 2021). Such patterns align with bounded-rationality frameworks, which posit that cognitive limitations and incomplete information lead consumers toward satisficing rather than optimizing energy decisions (Blasch, Filippini, & Kumar, 2019; Simon, 1957).\nThe emergence of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, introduces a novel technological affordance potentially capable of mitigating these cognitive barriers. Through natural language interaction, LLMs could ostensibly simplify complex energy information, provide tailored estimations of appliance consumption, and assist in formulating personalized conservation strategies, thereby augmenting users’ decision-making capabilities (Attari & Rajagopal, 2015). However, the practical utility and safety of employing LLMs in this quantitatively sensitive domain are contingent not only upon their evolving, yet imperfect, technical capabilities—which include a noted propensity for generating fluent but factually incorrect outputs or “hallucinations” (Choe et al., 2024)—but also, crucially, upon the dynamics of human-AI interaction.\nDespite the rapid integration of LLMs into various informational ecosystems, there remains a lack of empirical work on user perceptions of their specific competence and reliability for the nuanced, quantitative tasks inherent in household energy management. It is largely unknown whether individuals believe LLMs can accurately perform tasks known to challenge human intuition (Attari et al., 2010) or generate genuinely personalized and effective energy-saving plans. Specifically, how lay individuals perceive the capabilities of LLMs for distinct energy-related tasks, and the extent to which these perceptions are modulated by pertinent individual differences, remains a largely under-investigated empirical question.",

    "section": "Theoretical Framework",
    "text": "Theoretical Framework\nThis research is situated at the intersection of several theoretical domains relevant to energy decision-making, information processing, and human-AI interaction:\n\nMisperceptions, Cognitive Heuristics, and Bounded Rationality in Energy Judgments: Empirical work demonstrates that individuals possess flawed mental models of energy consumption and savings (Attari et al., 2010; Lesic et al., 2018). These misperceptions can lead to suboptimal energy-related decisions. An LLM, if perceived as knowledgeable and accurate, could potentially serve as an external source to correct these misperceptions or provide more reliable estimates, yet users’ beliefs about the AI’s ability to do so may themselves be subject to cognitive biases.\n\nWe adopt the empirically supported view that lay judgments about energy consumption are frequently inaccurate due to reliance on cognitive heuristics rather than deliberative calculation (Attari et al., 2010; Schley & DeKay, 2015). A crucial theoretical question is how the “calibration gap” (Steyvers et al. 2025) observed with LLMs plays out in the energy domain, where users already have significant pre-existing misperceptions. Will higher energy literacy, which provides a more accurate baseline understanding, enable users to better detect errors in LLM outputs, thus improving trust calibration? Will AI literacy, specifically the ‘Detect AI’ factor, play a similar role? Within a bounded rationality framework (Simon, 1957; Blasch et al., 2019), LLMs can be conceptualized as potential external cognitive aids; however, their effective use requires users to navigate both their own cognitive limitations and the credibility of AI-generated outputs.\n\nLiteracies as Modulators of Information Processing and Evaluation: Individual differences in cognitive skills and domain knowledge critically shape the ability to seek, interpret, evaluate, and act on complex information, including LLM outputs.\n\nEnergy Literacy, a multidimensional construct including cognitive knowledge, affective attitudes, and behavioral engagement (DeWaters & Powers, 2011; Van Den Broek, 2019), provides the necessary framework for assessing the plausibility and relevance of LLM energy advice (Andolfi et al., 2024). Higher cognitive energy literacy, specifically, should enable more discerning judgment.\nAI Literacy, encompassing knowledge of AI principles, capabilities, limitations, ethics, and critical evaluation skills (Carolus et al., 2023; Lintner, 2024; Pinski & Benlian, 2024), is theorized to directly influence perceptions of LLM functionality and the calibration of reliance. Understanding LLM fallibility is key for critical evaluation in specific domains, although literacy’s impact on mitigating over-reliance remains complex (Morrill & Noetel, 2023; Puppart & Aru, 2025).\nObjective Numeracy, the ability to comprehend and manipulate fundamental numerical concepts (Cokely et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2006), is essential for processing quantitative energy data (kWh, savings).\n\nCalibrated Trust Theory and Human-AI Reliance Dynamics: Trust, within the human-AI interaction paradigm, is conceived not as a monolithic entity but as a multifaceted psychological construct involving dynamic evaluations of an AI’s perceived competence, reliability, integrity, and potentially benevolence (Lee & See, 2004). These trust perceptions, potentially differentiable into cognitive (capability-based) and affective (relationally-based) components (Shang et al., 2025), are theorized to significantly influence decisions regarding reliance on AI systems (Buçinca et al., 2021; Chen & Zhao, 2025). Calibrated trust—a state where the user’s level of trust accurately aligns with the AI’s demonstrable performance characteristics for a given task—is considered optimal for promoting effective and safe collaboration. Beliefs about an AI’s specific capabilities (e.g., accuracy in energy estimation) serve as primary antecedents to cognitive trust judgments. However, broader dispositional trust or distrust in AI systems, potentially reflecting generalized attitudes or prior experiences, may further moderate reliance decisions, potentially overriding task-specific capability assessments (Scharowski et al., 2025; Carter & Liu, 2025). Recent findings also highlight potential dissociations between objective performance improvements facilitated by AI and users’ subjective metacognitive awareness, suggesting that reliance decisions may not always be grounded in accurate self-assessment of the human-AI dyad’s performance (Fernandes et al., 2024).\n\n\n3. Research Questions and Hypotheses\nThis study seeks to address the following research questions (RQs):\n\nRQ1: What are the prevailing lay beliefs concerning the accuracy and utility of contemporary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) for (a) estimating appliance-level electricity use, using metrics conceptually similar to those employed by Attari et al. (2010), and (b) designing personalized household energy-saving plans? How do individuals differentiate their trust in LLMs for providing specific factual energy information versus generating comprehensive, personalized plans?\nRQ2: To what extent do individual differences in objective numeracy (Berlin Numeracy Test), multidimensional energy literacy (cognitive knowledge, affective, and behavioral components), and AI literacy (MAILS short form facets) predict these lay beliefs about LLM capabilities (accuracy, utility, trustworthiness) in the energy domain?\nRQ3: How do perceptions of LLM accuracy for specific energy-related tasks and associated task-specific trust in LLM outputs jointly influence lay individuals’ self-reported willingness to utilize LLMs for energy-related decisions and their self-reported frequency of such usage in the recent past?\nRQ4: Do general trust and distrust in AI, measured via validated scales assessing factors like competence, benevolence, and integrity (TPA-revised) and semantic differentials (Semantic-Differential AI-Trust scale), mediate or moderate the relationship between specific beliefs about LLM capabilities for energy tasks and self-reported willingness/frequency of use?\n\nBased on the integration of the theoretical frameworks and empirical literature reviewed above, the following directional hypotheses (H) are proposed:\n\nH1: Laypeople will perceive LLMs as relatively accurate for energy estimation and planning, but their accuracy perceptions will reflect, to some extent, known human biases such as overestimating the impact of low-energy activities (curtailment) and underestimating high-energy activities (efficiency improvements).\nH2a: Higher objective numeracy will be associated with beliefs reflecting a potentially better-calibrated (i.e., less extreme or variable) assessment of LLM quantitative capabilities for energy estimation tasks compared to lower numeracy individuals.\nH2b: Higher energy literacy (particularly the cognitive knowledge component) will be associated with more critical evaluation of LLM outputs, potentially leading to beliefs that are more skeptical of LLM accuracy, especially concerning complex planning or nuanced energy concepts, compared to individuals with lower energy literacy who may lack the domain knowledge to identify implausible AI suggestions.\nH2c: Higher AI literacy (especially facets related to understanding limitations and critical evaluation from MAILS) will be associated with more cautious or nuanced beliefs about LLM capabilities, potentially mitigating tendencies towards uncritical acceptance of LLM accuracy claims. Conversely, high scores on AI usage/application facets might correlate with more positive beliefs, possibly reflecting positive past experiences or general technophilia, suggesting a potential interaction between understanding and application orientation.\nH3: More favorable beliefs regarding LLM accuracy and trustworthiness for energy tasks will be positively associated with greater self-reported willingness to use LLMs for energy decisions in the future, consistent with models where perceived competence and usefulness drive behavioral intentions (Chen & Zhao, 2025).\nH4: General trust in AI is hypothesized to mediate the positive relationship between favorable specific beliefs about LLM energy capabilities and willingness/frequency of use. That is, believing an LLM is effective for energy tasks may bolster general AI trust, which in turn promotes use intentions and reported behavior.",

This scale is designed for the general population and measures dimensions such as Use & Apply AI, Know & understand AI, Detect AI, AI Ethics, AI Self-efficacy, and AI Self-competency.\nGeneral Trust in AI: Assessed using items adapted from the TPA scale, focusing on the competence (capability/reliability) and benevolence/integrity factors, rephrased for general AI systems. This aligns with recommendations to use validated questionnaires where possible, while acknowledging the need for adaptation for the AI context.\nGeneral Distrust in AI: Assessed using items probing general skepticism, wariness, or lack of confidence in AI systems. (Note: Sources do not provide a specific validated scale for general distrust in AI. This measure will be developed based on common conceptualizations of distrust or adapted from relevant scales in human-automation literature, and its validity should be assessed. This is external information not found in the provided sources and would require independent verification.)\nSelf-Reported Willingness to Use LLMs for Energy Decisions: Participants will be asked about their likelihood of using an LLM in the future to get information about appliance energy use, estimate savings from actions, or help create an energy-saving plan (Likert scale).\nSelf-Reported Past-Month Frequency of Using LLMs for Energy Decisions: Participants will be asked how often (e.g., Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Very Often) they have used any LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) in the past month for tasks related to understanding or reducing their household energy consumption. Self-report measures of behavior are susceptible to social desirability bias and may reflect perceived behavior rather than actual behavior, but are necessary for assessing complex, infrequent actions.\n\n\n\nMeasuring User Mental Models of LLMs\n\nProbing Lay Beliefs and Mental Models of LLM Capabilities: This component assesses participants’ internal representations—their mental models—of how contemporary LLMs function and what they are capable of achieving within the household energy domain. Recognizing that lay users’ understanding of LLM mechanisms is often nascent and potentially filtered through pre-existing (mis)conceptions about both AI capabilities and energy use phenomena (Attari et al., 2010), we employ targeted probes. These aim to map users’ tacit theories regarding what an LLM “knows,” how it appears to reason, and where its limitations might lie, as these models are crucial prerequisites for achieving calibrated trust and determining appropriate verification strategies (Buçinca et al., 2021). Building on observations of a persistent “calibration gap” where user confidence can diverge from actual LLM reliability (Steyvers et al., 2025), we assess beliefs along several complementary dimensions:\n\nPerceived Factual Accuracy: This assesses beliefs about the LLM’s ability to provide correct, non-numerical information related to energy principles and conservation practices. Participants rate, using Likert-type scales (e.g., 1=Very Inaccurate, 7=Very Accurate), their confidence in a “state-of-the-art AI chatbot” to accurately answer qualitative or comparative questions, such as identifying the most energy-efficient type of appliance (e.g., “Which type of water heater generally uses less energy?”) or verifying common energy myths (e.g., “Is it true that appliances use no power when turned off but still plugged in?”). This probes perceived reliability for retrieving and presenting established domain knowledge, distinct from quantitative calculation.\nPerceived Estimation Accuracy: This focuses specifically on quantitative competence. Participants rate (similar Likert scales) their belief in the LLM’s accuracy for estimating numerical energy consumption metrics (e.g., annual kWh, operating cost in USD) for specific benchmark household appliances drawn from Attari et al. (2010), covering a range from low to high energy use (e.g., LED bulb, laptop computer, refrigerator, electric clothes dryer). Juxtaposing these ratings against known human bias patterns (e.g., range compression) allows exploration of whether users project their own difficulties onto the AI or expect superior quantitative performance.\nPerceived Planning Competence: This assesses beliefs about the LLM’s capability for more complex synthesis, personalization, and strategic reasoning tasks. Participants rate (similar scales) the perceived effectiveness, realism, and likely impact of an LLM in generating a personalized energy-saving plan tailored to a hypothetical household profile to meet a specific reduction goal (e.g., 15% usage cut). This probes beliefs about the LLM’s ability to identify high-impact actions, translate abstract goals into concrete steps, and account for contextual factors, moving beyond simple recall or estimation.\nTask-Specific Trust and Intended Reliance: Directly following the accuracy belief probes for factual answers, estimations, and plans, separate items assess trust and reliance specifically tied to those outputs. Using Likert scales (e.g., 1=Do not trust at all, 7=Trust completely), items ask: “How much would you trust the factual accuracy of this type of energy information provided by the AI?” or “How much would you trust this AI-generated estimate/plan to be reliable?”. Additional items probe reliance propensity, such as “How likely would you be to act on this specific advice/plan without seeking a second opinion?”. This differentiation allows examination of how trust and reliance intentions might vary across different perceived LLM functions (informant vs. calculator vs. advisor) and potentially diverge from perceived accuracy ratings.\nAttributional Beliefs To further unpack the underlying assumptions driving accuracy perceptions and trust, this section probes agreement (e.g., 1=Strongly Disagree, 7=Strongly Agree) with statements reflecting potential mental models of LLM operation in the energy context. Items tap into beliefs regarding:\n\nData Access & Knowledge Base: e.g., “The chatbot has real-time access to comprehensive and up-to-date energy usage databases.”\nPotential for Error/Fabrication: e.g., “The chatbot might sometimes confidently invent (‘hallucinate’) numbers or facts about energy that sound plausible but are incorrect.”\nContextual Understanding & Personalization: e.g., “The chatbot can accurately infer details about my specific home situation to give truly personalized advice.” vs. “The chatbot’s advice is likely too generic and ignores important variations between households.”\nNature of Processing: e.g., “The chatbot genuinely understands energy principles in a way similar to a human expert.” vs. “The chatbot primarily matches word patterns from its training data without true understanding.” These items aim to classify users’ mental models along continua such as expert-like/anthropomorphic versus statistical/pattern-matching, and data-rich/omniscient versus fallible/limited.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\nThe survey will be administered online. Participants will first provide informed consent. They will then complete measures of objective numeracy, energy literacy, and AI literacy. Subsequently, they will be presented with the hypothetical LLM outputs for appliance estimates and the energy-saving plan, providing their perceived accuracy and specific trust ratings for each. Finally, they will complete measures of general AI trust and distrust, and self-report on their willingness and past frequency of using LLMs for energy decisions. The order of presenting appliance estimates vs. energy plan may be counterbalanced to control for order effects. Debriefing will include information about the potential inaccuracies of current LLMs and links to reliable energy information resources.",

    "text": "Rationale and Implications\nUnderstanding lay beliefs about LLM capabilities in domains like household energy use is critically important. As LLMs become more accessible and widely used, they are likely to be consulted for practical advice, including complex areas where users already hold significant misperceptions. The energy domain is particularly relevant due to its importance for sustainability and the prevalence of bounded rationality in consumer decisions.\nA primary risk highlighted by this research context concerns the potential for miscalibrated trust, particularly over-trust. If lay users perceive LLMs as possessing high accuracy and trustworthiness for estimating appliance energy consumption or generating personalized saving plans—even when these systems may be prone to significant errors, biases, or “hallucinations” within this specific, often quantitatively complex, domain—reliance on such outputs could lead to detrimental outcomes. For example, consumers might base purchasing decisions for major appliances on inaccurate LLM-provided energy use estimates or dedicate effort towards implementing ineffective energy-saving plans derived from flawed AI advice. Such misplaced reliance could not only undermine genuine energy reduction goals but also engender user frustration, potentially leading to disillusionment and disengagement from broader energy conservation efforts when anticipated savings fail to materialize. This risk is amplified by findings suggesting users may sometimes overestimate LLM accuracy, potentially influenced by factors like the fluency or apparent confidence of the AI’s output (Fernandes et al., 2024; Horowitz & Kahn, 2023).\nConversely, significant under-trust or excessive skepticism towards LLMs for energy-related tasks could also prove suboptimal. If potential users unduly distrust LLMs, even when they might offer genuinely helpful capabilities (e.g., rapidly calculating lifetime operating costs, providing accessible summaries of complex efficiency standards, or suggesting relevant conservation actions users hadn’t considered; Attari & Rajagopal, 2015), this could impede the adoption and effective utilization of a potentially valuable decision-support technology. Understanding which individual factors—such as levels of numeracy, domain-specific energy literacy, or broader AI literacy and trust orientations—predict tendencies towards either over- or under-trust is therefore crucial for designing effective user interfaces, educational interventions, or “cognitive forcing functions” (Buçinca et al., 2021) aimed at fostering better trust calibration.\nThis study’s investigation into how numeracy, different types of energy literacy, and dimensions of AI literacy relate to perceptions of LLM accuracy and trust will illuminate who is more susceptible to these potential trust calibration issues. For instance, are individuals with low energy literacy but high general trust in technology or high AI self-efficacy more likely to over-trust LLMs in the energy domain? Does having some degree of energy literacy, particularly device or action literacy, enable users to better critically evaluate LLM-generated energy information (“Detect AI” in action)? The findings could inform the design of LLM interactions that better scaffold user understanding, highlight uncertainties, and encourage appropriate verification, ultimately helping users leverage AI as a tool to overcome, rather than potentially reinforce, cognitive barriers to energy conservation.",

    "section": "Background and Rationale",
    "text": "Background and Rationale\nAchieving substantial reductions in residential energy consumption remains a critical, yet elusive, goal for climate mitigation efforts, often hampered by the complexities of consumer cognition and decision-making. A robust literature establishes that lay understanding of household energy use is frequently characterized by systematic misperceptions, particularly the concurrent underestimation of high-consumption activities (e.g., heating, major appliances) and overestimation of savings from lower-impact actions (e.g., turning off lights), phenomena extensively documented by Attari et al. (2010) and others (Kantenbacher & Attari, 2021). These inaccuracies, often stemming from reliance on readily available but potentially misleading cognitive heuristics—such as judging energy use by appliance visibility, operational duration, or perceived heat output (Schille-Hudson et al. 2021). Such patterns align with bounded-rationality frameworks, which posit that cognitive limitations and incomplete information lead consumers toward satisficing rather than optimizing energy decisions (Blasch, Filippini, & Kumar, 2019; Simon, 1957).\nThe emergence of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, introduces a novel technological affordance potentially capable of mitigating these cognitive barriers. Through natural language interaction, LLMs could ostensibly simplify complex energy information, provide tailored estimations of appliance consumption, and assist in formulating personalized conservation strategies, thereby augmenting users’ decision-making capabilities (Attari & Rajagopal, 2015). However, the practical utility and safety of employing LLMs in this quantitatively sensitive domain are contingent not only upon their evolving, yet imperfect, technical capabilities—which include a noted propensity for generating fluent but factually incorrect outputs or “hallucinations” (Choe et al., 2024)—but also, crucially, upon the dynamics of human-AI interaction.\nDespite the rapid integration of LLMs into various informational ecosystems, there remains a lack of empirical work on user perceptions of their specific competence and reliability for the nuanced, quantitative tasks inherent in household energy management. It is largely unknown whether individuals believe LLMs can accurately perform tasks known to challenge human intuition (Attari et al., 2010) or generate genuinely personalized and effective energy-saving plans. Specifically, how lay individuals perceive the capabilities of LLMs for distinct energy-related tasks, and the extent to which these perceptions are modulated by pertinent individual differences, remains a largely under-investigated empirical question.",

    "section": "Theoretical Framework",
    "text": "Theoretical Framework\nThis research is situated at the intersection of several theoretical domains relevant to energy decision-making, information processing, and human-AI interaction:\n\nMisperceptions, Cognitive Heuristics, and Bounded Rationality in Energy Judgments: Empirical work demonstrates that individuals possess flawed mental models of energy consumption and savings (Attari et al., 2010; Lesic et al., 2018). These misperceptions can lead to suboptimal energy-related decisions. An LLM, if perceived as knowledgeable and accurate, could potentially serve as an external source to correct these misperceptions or provide more reliable estimates, yet users’ beliefs about the AI’s ability to do so may themselves be subject to cognitive biases.\n\nWe adopt the empirically supported view that lay judgments about energy consumption are frequently inaccurate due to reliance on cognitive heuristics rather than deliberative calculation (Attari et al., 2010; Schley & DeKay, 2015). A crucial theoretical question is how the “calibration gap” (Steyvers et al. 2025) observed with LLMs plays out in the energy domain, where users already have significant pre-existing misperceptions. Will higher energy literacy, which provides a more accurate baseline understanding, enable users to better detect errors in LLM outputs, thus improving trust calibration? Will AI literacy, specifically the ‘Detect AI’ factor, play a similar role? Within a bounded rationality framework (Simon, 1957; Blasch et al., 2019), LLMs can be conceptualized as potential external cognitive aids; however, their effective use requires users to navigate both their own cognitive limitations and the credibility of AI-generated outputs.\n\nLiteracies as Modulators of Information Processing and Evaluation: Individual differences in cognitive skills and domain knowledge critically shape the ability to seek, interpret, evaluate, and act on complex information, including LLM outputs.\n\nEnergy Literacy, a multidimensional construct including cognitive knowledge, affective attitudes, and behavioral engagement (DeWaters & Powers, 2011; Van Den Broek, 2019), provides the necessary framework for assessing the plausibility and relevance of LLM energy advice (Andolfi et al., 2024). Higher cognitive energy literacy, specifically, should enable more discerning judgment.\nAI Literacy, encompassing knowledge of AI principles, capabilities, limitations, ethics, and critical evaluation skills (Carolus et al., 2023; Lintner, 2024; Pinski & Benlian, 2024), is theorized to directly influence perceptions of LLM functionality and the calibration of reliance. Understanding LLM fallibility is key for critical evaluation in specific domains, although literacy’s impact on mitigating over-reliance remains complex (Morrill & Noetel, 2023; Puppart & Aru, 2025).\nObjective Numeracy, the ability to comprehend and manipulate fundamental numerical concepts (Cokely et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2006), is essential for processing quantitative energy data (kWh, savings).\n\nCalibrated Trust Theory and Human-AI Reliance Dynamics: Trust, within the human-AI interaction paradigm, is conceived not as a monolithic entity but as a multifaceted psychological construct involving dynamic evaluations of an AI’s perceived competence, reliability, integrity, and potentially benevolence (Lee & See, 2004). These trust perceptions, potentially differentiable into cognitive (capability-based) and affective (relationally-based) components (Shang et al., 2025), are theorized to significantly influence decisions regarding reliance on AI systems (Buçinca et al., 2021; Chen & Zhao, 2025). Calibrated trust—a state where the user’s level of trust accurately aligns with the AI’s demonstrable performance characteristics for a given task—is considered optimal for promoting effective and safe collaboration. Beliefs about an AI’s specific capabilities (e.g., accuracy in energy estimation) serve as primary antecedents to cognitive trust judgments. However, broader dispositional trust or distrust in AI systems, potentially reflecting generalized attitudes or prior experiences, may further moderate reliance decisions, potentially overriding task-specific capability assessments (Scharowski et al., 2025; Carter & Liu, 2025). Recent findings also highlight potential dissociations between objective performance improvements facilitated by AI and users’ subjective metacognitive awareness, suggesting that reliance decisions may not always be grounded in accurate self-assessment of the human-AI dyad’s performance (Fernandes et al., 2024).\n\n\n3. Research Questions and Hypotheses\nThis study seeks to address the following research questions (RQs):\n\nRQ1: What are the prevailing lay beliefs concerning the accuracy and utility of contemporary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) for (a) estimating appliance-level electricity use, using metrics conceptually similar to those employed by Attari et al. (2010), and (b) designing personalized household energy-saving plans? How do individuals differentiate their trust in LLMs for providing specific factual energy information versus generating comprehensive, personalized plans?\nRQ2: To what extent do individual differences in objective numeracy (Berlin Numeracy Test), multidimensional energy literacy (cognitive knowledge, affective, and behavioral components), and AI literacy (MAILS short form facets) predict these lay beliefs about LLM capabilities (accuracy, utility, trustworthiness) in the energy domain?\nRQ3: How do perceptions of LLM accuracy for specific energy-related tasks and associated task-specific trust in LLM outputs jointly influence lay individuals’ self-reported willingness to utilize LLMs for energy-related decisions and their self-reported frequency of such usage in the recent past?\nRQ4: Do general trust and distrust in AI, measured via validated scales assessing factors like competence, benevolence, and integrity (TPA-revised) and semantic differentials (Semantic-Differential AI-Trust scale), mediate or moderate the relationship between specific beliefs about LLM capabilities for energy tasks and self-reported willingness/frequency of use?\n\nBased on the integration of the theoretical frameworks and empirical literature reviewed above, the following directional hypotheses (H) are proposed:\n\nH1: Laypeople will perceive LLMs as relatively accurate for energy estimation and planning, but their accuracy perceptions will reflect, to some extent, known human biases such as overestimating the impact of low-energy activities (curtailment) and underestimating high-energy activities (efficiency improvements).\nH2a: Higher objective numeracy will be associated with beliefs reflecting a potentially better-calibrated (i.e., less extreme or variable) assessment of LLM quantitative capabilities for energy estimation tasks compared to lower numeracy individuals.\nH2b: Higher energy literacy (particularly the cognitive knowledge component) will be associated with more critical evaluation of LLM outputs, potentially leading to beliefs that are more skeptical of LLM accuracy, especially concerning complex planning or nuanced energy concepts, compared to individuals with lower energy literacy who may lack the domain knowledge to identify implausible AI suggestions.\nH2c: Higher AI literacy (especially facets related to understanding limitations and critical evaluation from MAILS) will be associated with more cautious or nuanced beliefs about LLM capabilities, potentially mitigating tendencies towards uncritical acceptance of LLM accuracy claims. Conversely, high scores on AI usage/application facets might correlate with more positive beliefs, possibly reflecting positive past experiences or general technophilia, suggesting a potential interaction between understanding and application orientation.\nH3: More favorable beliefs regarding LLM accuracy and trustworthiness for energy tasks will be positively associated with greater self-reported willingness to use LLMs for energy decisions in the future, consistent with models where perceived competence and usefulness drive behavioral intentions (Chen & Zhao, 2025).\nH4: General trust in AI is hypothesized to mediate the positive relationship between favorable specific beliefs about LLM energy capabilities and willingness/frequency of use. That is, believing an LLM is effective for energy tasks may bolster general AI trust, which in turn promotes use intentions and reported behavior.",

    "text": "Methods\nDesign: This study will employ a quantitative, cross-sectional online survey design to concurrently assess individual differences, beliefs, trust perceptions, and self-reported behavioral intentions and past behavior regarding LLM use for energy decisions.\n\nIndividual Difference Measures (Predictors):\nThe survey will collect data on the following measures:\n\nObjective Numeracy: Assessed using a validated measure such as the Berlin Numeracy Test.\nMultidimensional Energy Literacy: Assessed using a composite measure drawing items from existing literature or scales covering device energy literacy, action energy literacy, and financial energy literacy, aligned with the typology by Van Den Broek. Items will probe knowledge about typical energy consumption of various appliances (e.g., refrigerator, lighting, HVAC) and estimated savings from common actions (e.g., adjusting thermostat, using energy-efficient bulbs). Financial energy literacy items will assess understanding of concepts like lifetime cost.\nAI Literacy: Assessed using the MAILS short form questionnaire. This scale is designed for the general population and measures dimensions such as Use & Apply AI, Know & understand AI, Detect AI, AI Ethics, AI Self-efficacy, and AI Self-competency.\nGeneral Trust in AI: Assessed using items adapted from the TPA scale, focusing on the competence (capability/reliability) and benevolence/integrity factors, rephrased for general AI systems. This aligns with recommendations to use validated questionnaires where possible, while acknowledging the need for adaptation for the AI context.\nGeneral Distrust in AI: Assessed using items probing general skepticism, wariness, or lack of confidence in AI systems.\nSelf-Reported Willingness to Use LLMs for Energy Decisions: Participants will be asked about their likelihood of using an LLM in the future to get information about appliance energy use, estimate savings from actions, or help create an energy-saving plan (Likert scale).\nSelf-Reported Past-Month Frequency of Using LLMs for Energy Decisions: Participants will be asked how often (e.g., Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Very Often) they have used any LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) in the past month for tasks related to understanding or reducing their household energy consumption. Self-report measures of behavior are susceptible to social desirability bias and may reflect perceived behavior rather than actual behavior, but are necessary for assessing complex, infrequent actions.\n\n\n\nMeasuring User Mental Models of LLMs\n\nProbing Lay Beliefs and Mental Models of LLM Capabilities: This component assesses participants’ internal representations—their mental models—of how contemporary LLMs function and what they are capable of achieving within the household energy domain. Recognizing that lay users’ understanding of LLM mechanisms is often nascent and potentially filtered through pre-existing (mis)conceptions about both AI capabilities and energy use phenomena (Attari et al., 2010), we employ targeted probes. These aim to map users’ tacit theories regarding what an LLM “knows,” how it appears to reason, and where its limitations might lie, as these models are crucial prerequisites for achieving calibrated trust and determining appropriate verification strategies (Buçinca et al., 2021). Building on observations of a persistent “calibration gap” where user confidence can diverge from actual LLM reliability (Steyvers et al., 2025), we assess beliefs along several complementary dimensions:\n\nPerceived Factual Accuracy: This assesses beliefs about the LLM’s ability to provide correct, non-numerical information related to energy principles and conservation practices. Participants rate, using Likert-type scales (e.g., 1=Very Inaccurate, 7=Very Accurate), their confidence in a “state-of-the-art AI chatbot” to accurately answer qualitative or comparative questions, such as identifying the most energy-efficient type of appliance (e.g., “Which type of water heater generally uses less energy?”) or verifying common energy myths (e.g., “Is it true that appliances use no power when turned off but still plugged in?”). This probes perceived reliability for retrieving and presenting established domain knowledge, distinct from quantitative calculation.\nPerceived Estimation Accuracy: This focuses specifically on quantitative competence. Participants rate (similar Likert scales) their belief in the LLM’s accuracy for estimating numerical energy consumption metrics (e.g., annual kWh, operating cost in USD) for specific benchmark household appliances drawn from Attari et al. (2010), covering a range from low to high energy use (e.g., LED bulb, laptop computer, refrigerator, electric clothes dryer). Juxtaposing these ratings against known human bias patterns (e.g., range compression) allows exploration of whether users project their own difficulties onto the AI or expect superior quantitative performance.\nPerceived Planning Competence: This assesses beliefs about the LLM’s capability for more complex synthesis, personalization, and strategic reasoning tasks. Participants rate (similar scales) the perceived effectiveness, realism, and likely impact of an LLM in generating a personalized energy-saving plan tailored to a hypothetical household profile to meet a specific reduction goal (e.g., 15% usage cut). This probes beliefs about the LLM’s ability to identify high-impact actions, translate abstract goals into concrete steps, and account for contextual factors, moving beyond simple recall or estimation.\nTask-Specific Trust and Intended Reliance: Directly following the accuracy belief probes for factual answers, estimations, and plans, separate items assess trust and reliance specifically tied to those outputs. Using Likert scales (e.g., 1=Do not trust at all, 7=Trust completely), items ask: “How much would you trust the factual accuracy of this type of energy information provided by the AI?” or “How much would you trust this AI-generated estimate/plan to be reliable?”. Additional items probe reliance propensity, such as “How likely would you be to act on this specific advice/plan without seeking a second opinion?”. This differentiation allows examination of how trust and reliance intentions might vary across different perceived LLM functions (informant vs. calculator vs. advisor) and potentially diverge from perceived accuracy ratings.\nAttributional Beliefs To further unpack the underlying assumptions driving accuracy perceptions and trust, this section probes agreement (e.g., 1=Strongly Disagree, 7=Strongly Agree) with statements reflecting potential mental models of LLM operation in the energy context. Items tap into beliefs regarding:\n\nData Access & Knowledge Base: e.g., “The chatbot has real-time access to comprehensive and up-to-date energy usage databases.”\nPotential for Error/Fabrication: e.g., “The chatbot might sometimes confidently invent (‘hallucinate’) numbers or facts about energy that sound plausible but are incorrect.”\nContextual Understanding & Personalization: e.g., “The chatbot can accurately infer details about my specific home situation to give truly personalized advice.” vs. “The chatbot’s advice is likely too generic and ignores important variations between households.”\nNature of Processing: e.g., “The chatbot genuinely understands energy principles in a way similar to a human expert.” vs. “The chatbot primarily matches word patterns from its training data without true understanding.” These items aim to classify users’ mental models along continua such as expert-like/anthropomorphic versus statistical/pattern-matching, and data-rich/omniscient versus fallible/limited.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\nThe survey will be administered online. Participants will first provide informed consent. They will then complete measures of objective numeracy, energy literacy, and AI literacy. Subsequently, they will be presented with the hypothetical LLM outputs for appliance estimates and the energy-saving plan, providing their perceived accuracy and specific trust ratings for each. Finally, they will complete measures of general AI trust and distrust, and self-report on their willingness and past frequency of using LLMs for energy decisions. The order of presenting appliance estimates vs. energy plan may be counterbalanced to control for order effects. Debriefing will include information about the potential inaccuracies of current LLMs and links to reliable energy information resources.",

    "section": "Rationale and Implications",
    "text": "Rationale and Implications\nUnderstanding lay beliefs about LLM capabilities in domains like household energy use is critically important. As LLMs become more accessible and widely used, they are likely to be consulted for practical advice, including complex areas where users already hold significant misperceptions. The energy domain is particularly relevant due to its importance for sustainability and the prevalence of bounded rationality in consumer decisions.\nA primary risk highlighted by this research context concerns the potential for miscalibrated trust, particularly over-trust. If lay users perceive LLMs as possessing high accuracy and trustworthiness for estimating appliance energy consumption or generating personalized saving plans—even when these systems may be prone to significant errors, biases, or “hallucinations” within this specific, often quantitatively complex, domain—reliance on such outputs could lead to detrimental outcomes. For example, consumers might base purchasing decisions for major appliances on inaccurate LLM-provided energy use estimates or dedicate effort towards implementing ineffective energy-saving plans derived from flawed AI advice. Such misplaced reliance could not only undermine genuine energy reduction goals but also engender user frustration, potentially leading to disillusionment and disengagement from broader energy conservation efforts when anticipated savings fail to materialize. This risk is amplified by findings suggesting users may sometimes overestimate LLM accuracy, potentially influenced by factors like the fluency or apparent confidence of the AI’s output (Fernandes et al., 2024; Horowitz & Kahn, 2023).\nConversely, significant under-trust or excessive skepticism towards LLMs for energy-related tasks could also prove suboptimal. If potential users unduly distrust LLMs, even when they might offer genuinely helpful capabilities (e.g., rapidly calculating lifetime operating costs, providing accessible summaries of complex efficiency standards, or suggesting relevant conservation actions users hadn’t considered; Attari & Rajagopal, 2015), this could impede the adoption and effective utilization of a potentially valuable decision-support technology. Understanding which individual factors—such as levels of numeracy, domain-specific energy literacy, or broader AI literacy and trust orientations—predict tendencies towards either over- or under-trust is therefore crucial for designing effective user interfaces, educational interventions, or “cognitive forcing functions” (Buçinca et al., 2021) aimed at fostering better trust calibration.\nThis study’s investigation into how numeracy, different types of energy literacy, and dimensions of AI literacy relate to perceptions of LLM accuracy and trust will illuminate who is more susceptible to these potential trust calibration issues. For instance, are individuals with low energy literacy but high general trust in technology or high AI self-efficacy more likely to over-trust LLMs in the energy domain? Does having some degree of energy literacy, particularly device or action literacy, enable users to better critically evaluate LLM-generated energy information (“Detect AI” in action)? The findings could inform the design of LLM interactions that better scaffold user understanding, highlight uncertainties, and encourage appropriate verification, ultimately helping users leverage AI as a tool to overcome, rather than potentially reinforce, cognitive barriers to energy conservation.",

    "text": "B.8 AI governance challenges\nWe would like you to consider some potential policy issues related to AI. Please consider the following:\n[Respondents were shown five randomly-selected items from the list below, one item at a time. For ease of comprehension, we include the shorten labels used in the figures in square brackets.]\n\n[Hiring bias] Fairness and transparency in AI used in hiring: Increasingly, employers are using AI to make hiring decisions. AI has the potential to make less biased hiring decisions than humans. But algorithms trained on biased data can lead to lead to hiring practices that discriminate against certain groups. Also, AI used in this application may lack transparency, such that human users do not understand what the algorithm is doing, or why it reaches certain decisions in specific cases.\n[Criminal justice bias] Fairness and transparency in AI used in criminal justice: Increasingly, the criminal justice system is using AI to make sentencing and parole decisions. AI has the potential to make less biased hiring decisions than humans. But algorithms trained on biased data could lead to discrimination against certain groups. Also, AI used in this application may lack transparency such that human users do not understand what the algorithm is doing, or why it reaches certain decisions in specific cases.\n[Disease diagnosis] Accuracy and transparency in AI used for disease diagnosis: Increasingly, AI software has been used to diagnose diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. One challenge is to make sure the AI can correctly diagnose those who have the disease and not mistakenly diagnose those who do not have the disease. Another challenge is that AI used in this application may lack transparency such that human users do not understand what the algorithm is doing, or why it reaches certain decisions in specific cases.\n[Data privacy] Protect data privacy: Algorithms used in AI applications are often trained on vast amounts of personal data, including medical records, social media content, and financial transactions. Some worry that data used to train algorithms are not collected, used, and stored in ways that protect personal privacy.\n[Autonomous vehicles] Make sure autonomous vehicles are safe: Companies are developing self-driving cars and trucks that require little or no input from humans. Some worry about the safety of autonomous vehicles for those riding in them as well as for other vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.\n[Digital manipulation] Prevent AI from being used to spread fake and harmful content online: AI has been used by governments, private groups, and individuals to harm or manipulate internet users. For instance, automated bots have been used to generate and spread false and/or harmful news stories, audios, and videos.\n[Cyber attacks] Prevent AI cyber attacks against governments, companies, organizations, and individuals: Computer scientists have shown that AI can be used to launch effective cyber attacks. AI could be used to hack into servers to steal sensitive information, shut down critical infrastructures like power grids or hospital networks, or scale up targeted phishing attacks.\n[Surveillance] Prevent AI-assisted surveillance from violating privacy and civil liberties: AI can be used to process and analyze large amounts of text, photo, audio, and video data from social media, mobile communications, and CCTV cameras. Some worry that governments, companies, and employers could use AI to increase their surveillance capabilities.\n[U.S.-China arms race] Prevent escalation of a U.S.-China AI arms race: Leading analysts believe that an AI arms race is beginning, in which the U.S. and China are investing billions of dollars to develop powerful AI systems for surveillance, autonomous weapons, cyber operations, propaganda, and command and control systems. Some worry that a U.S.-China arms race could lead to extreme dangers. To stay ahead, the U.S. and China may race to deploy advanced military AI systems that they do not fully understand or can control. We could see catastrophic accidents, such as a rapid, automated escalation involving cyber and nuclear weapons.\n[Value alignment] Make sure AI systems are safe, trustworthy, and aligned with human values: As AI systems become more advanced, they will increasingly make decisions without human input. One potential fear is that AI systems, while performing jobs they are programmed to do, could unintentionally make decisions that go against the values of its human users, such as physically harming people.\n[Autonomous weapons] Ban the use of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs): Lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) are military robots that can attack targets without control by humans. LAWs could reduce the use of human combatants on the battlefield. But some worry that the adoption of LAWs could lead to mass violence. Because they are cheap and easy to produce in bulk, national militaries, terrorists, and other groups could readily deploy LAWs.\n[Technological unemployment] Guarantee a good standard of living for those who lose their jobs to automation: Some forecast that AI will increasingly be able to do jobs done by humans today. AI could potentially do the jobs of blue-collar workers, like truckers and factory workers, as well as the jobs of white-collar workers, like financial analysts or lawyers. Some worry that in the future, robots and computers can do most of the jobs that are done by humans today.\n[Critical AI systems failure] Prevent critical AI systems failures: As AI systems become more advanced, they could be used by the military or in critical infrastructure, like power grids, highways, or hospital networks. Some worry that the failure of AI systems or unintentional accidents in these applications could cause 10 percent or more of all humans to die.\n\nQUESTION:\nIn the next 10 years, how likely do you think it is that this AI governance challenge will impact large numbers of people in the U.S.?\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nVery unlikely: less than 5% chance (2.5%)\nUnlikely: 5-20% chance (12.5%)\nSomewhat unlikely: 20-40% chance (30%)\nEqually likely as unlikely: 40-60% chance (50%)\nSomewhat likely: 60-80% chance (70%)\nLikely: 80-95% chance (87.5%)\nVery likely: more than 95% chance (97.5%)\nI don’t know\n\nQUESTION:\nIn the next 10 years, how likely do you think it is that this AI governance challenge will impact large numbers of people around the world?\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nVery unlikely: less than 5% chance (2.5%)\nUnlikely: 5-20% chance (12.5%)\nSomewhat unlikely: 20-40% chance (30%)\nEqually likely as unlikely: 40-60% chance (50%)\nSomewhat likely: 60-80% chance (70%)\nLikely: 80-95% chance (87.5%)\nVery likely: more than 95% chance (97.5%)\nI don’t know\n\nQUESTION:\nIn the next 10 years, how important is it for tech companies and governments to carefully manage the following challenge?\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nVery important (3)\nSomewhat important (2)\nNot too important (1)\nNot at all important (0)\nI don’t know"

    "text": "B.10 Survey experiment: U.S.-China arms race\n[All respondents were presented with the following prompt.]\nWe want to understand your thoughts on some important issues in the news today. Please read the short news article below.\nLeading analysts believe that an “AI arms race” is beginning, in which the U.S. and China are investing billions of dollars to develop powerful AI systems for surveillance, autonomous weapons, cyber operations, propaganda, and command and control systems.\n[Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups listed below.]\n\nB.10.1 Control\n[No additional text.]\n\n\nB.10.2 Nationalism treatment\nSome leaders in the U.S. military and tech industry argue that the U.S. government should invest much more resources in AI research to ensure that the U.S.’s AI capabilities stay ahead of China’s. Furthermore, they argue that the U.S. government should partner with American tech companies to develop advanced AI systems, particularly for military use.\nAccording to a leaked memo produced by a senior National Security Council official, China has “assembled the basic components required for winning the Al arms race…Much like America’s success in the competition for nuclear weapons, China’s 21st Century Manhattan Project sets them on a path to getting there first.”\n\n\nB.10.3 War risks treatment\nSome prominent thinkers are concerned that a U.S.-China arms race could lead to extreme dangers. To stay ahead, the U.S. and China may race to deploy advanced military AI systems that they do not fully understand or can control. We could see catastrophic accidents, such as a rapid, automated escalation involving cyber and nuclear weapons.\n“Competition for AI superiority at [the] national level [is the] most likely cause of World War Three,” warned Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n\nB.10.4 Common humanity treatment\nSome prominent thinkers are concerned that a U.S.-China arms race could lead to extreme dangers. To stay ahead, the U.S. and China may race to deploy advanced military AI systems that they do not fully understand or can control. We could see catastrophic accidents, such as a rapid, automated escalation involving cyber and nuclear weapons.\n“Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons,” warned the late Stephen Hawking, one of the world’s most prominent physicists. At the same time, he said that with proper management of the technology, researchers “can create AI for the good of the world.”\n[The order of the next two questions is randomized.]\nQUESTION:\nHow much do you agree or disagree with the following statement?\nThe U.S. should invest more in AI military capabilities to make sure it doesn’t fall behind China’s, even if doing so may exacerbate the arms race. For instance, the U.S. could increase AI research funding for the military and universities. It could also collaborate with American tech companies to develop AI for military use.\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nStrongly agree (2)\nSomewhat agree (1)\nNeither agree nor disagree (0)\nSomewhat disagree (-1)\nStrongly disagree (-2)\nI don’t know\n\nQUESTION:\nHow much do you agree or disagree with the following statement?\nThe U.S. should work hard to cooperate with China to avoid the dangers of an AI arms race, even if doing so requires giving up some of the U.S.’s advantages. Cooperation could include collaborations between American and Chinese AI research labs, or the U.S. and China creating and committing to common safety standards.\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nStrongly agree (2)\nSomewhat agree (1)\nNeither agree nor disagree (0)\nSomewhat disagree (-1)\nStrongly disagree (-2)\nI don’t know"

What will you do next?\nIn this study, you will complete a set of information-seeking tasks with the help of an AI system prototype named A. Each task involves determining the correct answer to the presented question. You will see AI system A’s answer to the question. If you want, you can also use other resources (e.g., internet, books, friends and family).\nYou will complete 8 tasks in total. After all tasks, you will complete an exit questionnaire that asks about your experience and perception of the AI system, demographics, and other background.

When asked questions or given instructions, LLMs can generate human-like responses. These generated responses can sound convincing and fluent, but may not always be correct.\nLLMs can be used for many tasks, including question answering, text summarization, creative writing, and programming. You may have used or heard about some popular applications using LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Bing Chat, and Google’s Bard. Some are connected to the Internet, while others are not.\nIn this study, we will show you responses from the AI system prototype named A that uses similar technology to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. AI system A is connected to the internet and can answer a wide range of questions. It also sometimes provides sources for its answers. However, as with all AI systems, its responses, including the provided sources, may be inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent, even when they sound convincing.\n\n\n\nTask comprehension questions\n[CONTROL, UNCERTAIN1ST, UNCERTAINGENERAL Conditions]\nQ.
