    "text": "B.8 AI governance challenges\nWe would like you to consider some potential policy issues related to AI. Please consider the following:\n[Respondents were shown five randomly-selected items from the list below, one item at a time. For ease of comprehension, we include the shorten labels used in the figures in square brackets.]\n\n[Hiring bias] Fairness and transparency in AI used in hiring: Increasingly, employers are using AI to make hiring decisions. AI has the potential to make less biased hiring decisions than humans. But algorithms trained on biased data can lead to lead to hiring practices that discriminate against certain groups. Also, AI used in this application may lack transparency, such that human users do not understand what the algorithm is doing, or why it reaches certain decisions in specific cases.\n[Criminal justice bias] Fairness and transparency in AI used in criminal justice: Increasingly, the criminal justice system is using AI to make sentencing and parole decisions. AI has the potential to make less biased hiring decisions than humans. But algorithms trained on biased data could lead to discrimination against certain groups. Also, AI used in this application may lack transparency such that human users do not understand what the algorithm is doing, or why it reaches certain decisions in specific cases.\n[Disease diagnosis] Accuracy and transparency in AI used for disease diagnosis: Increasingly, AI software has been used to diagnose diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. One challenge is to make sure the AI can correctly diagnose those who have the disease and not mistakenly diagnose those who do not have the disease. Another challenge is that AI used in this application may lack transparency such that human users do not understand what the algorithm is doing, or why it reaches certain decisions in specific cases.\n[Data privacy] Protect data privacy: Algorithms used in AI applications are often trained on vast amounts of personal data, including medical records, social media content, and financial transactions. Some worry that data used to train algorithms are not collected, used, and stored in ways that protect personal privacy.\n[Autonomous vehicles] Make sure autonomous vehicles are safe: Companies are developing self-driving cars and trucks that require little or no input from humans. Some worry about the safety of autonomous vehicles for those riding in them as well as for other vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.\n[Digital manipulation] Prevent AI from being used to spread fake and harmful content online: AI has been used by governments, private groups, and individuals to harm or manipulate internet users. For instance, automated bots have been used to generate and spread false and/or harmful news stories, audios, and videos.\n[Cyber attacks] Prevent AI cyber attacks against governments, companies, organizations, and individuals: Computer scientists have shown that AI can be used to launch effective cyber attacks. AI could be used to hack into servers to steal sensitive information, shut down critical infrastructures like power grids or hospital networks, or scale up targeted phishing attacks.\n[Surveillance] Prevent AI-assisted surveillance from violating privacy and civil liberties: AI can be used to process and analyze large amounts of text, photo, audio, and video data from social media, mobile communications, and CCTV cameras. Some worry that governments, companies, and employers could use AI to increase their surveillance capabilities.\n[U.S.-China arms race] Prevent escalation of a U.S.-China AI arms race: Leading analysts believe that an AI arms race is beginning, in which the U.S. and China are investing billions of dollars to develop powerful AI systems for surveillance, autonomous weapons, cyber operations, propaganda, and command and control systems. Some worry that a U.S.-China arms race could lead to extreme dangers. To stay ahead, the U.S. and China may race to deploy advanced military AI systems that they do not fully understand or can control. We could see catastrophic accidents, such as a rapid, automated escalation involving cyber and nuclear weapons.\n[Value alignment] Make sure AI systems are safe, trustworthy, and aligned with human values: As AI systems become more advanced, they will increasingly make decisions without human input. One potential fear is that AI systems, while performing jobs they are programmed to do, could unintentionally make decisions that go against the values of its human users, such as physically harming people.\n[Autonomous weapons] Ban the use of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs): Lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) are military robots that can attack targets without control by humans. LAWs could reduce the use of human combatants on the battlefield. But some worry that the adoption of LAWs could lead to mass violence. Because they are cheap and easy to produce in bulk, national militaries, terrorists, and other groups could readily deploy LAWs.\n[Technological unemployment] Guarantee a good standard of living for those who lose their jobs to automation: Some forecast that AI will increasingly be able to do jobs done by humans today. AI could potentially do the jobs of blue-collar workers, like truckers and factory workers, as well as the jobs of white-collar workers, like financial analysts or lawyers. Some worry that in the future, robots and computers can do most of the jobs that are done by humans today.\n[Critical AI systems failure] Prevent critical AI systems failures: As AI systems become more advanced, they could be used by the military or in critical infrastructure, like power grids, highways, or hospital networks. Some worry that the failure of AI systems or unintentional accidents in these applications could cause 10 percent or more of all humans to die.\n\nQUESTION:\nIn the next 10 years, how likely do you think it is that this AI governance challenge will impact large numbers of people in the U.S.?\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nVery unlikely: less than 5% chance (2.5%)\nUnlikely: 5-20% chance (12.5%)\nSomewhat unlikely: 20-40% chance (30%)\nEqually likely as unlikely: 40-60% chance (50%)\nSomewhat likely: 60-80% chance (70%)\nLikely: 80-95% chance (87.5%)\nVery likely: more than 95% chance (97.5%)\nI don’t know\n\nQUESTION:\nIn the next 10 years, how likely do you think it is that this AI governance challenge will impact large numbers of people around the world?\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nVery unlikely: less than 5% chance (2.5%)\nUnlikely: 5-20% chance (12.5%)\nSomewhat unlikely: 20-40% chance (30%)\nEqually likely as unlikely: 40-60% chance (50%)\nSomewhat likely: 60-80% chance (70%)\nLikely: 80-95% chance (87.5%)\nVery likely: more than 95% chance (97.5%)\nI don’t know\n\nQUESTION:\nIn the next 10 years, how important is it for tech companies and governments to carefully manage the following challenge?\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nVery important (3)\nSomewhat important (2)\nNot too important (1)\nNot at all important (0)\nI don’t know"

    "text": "B.10 Survey experiment: U.S.-China arms race\n[All respondents were presented with the following prompt.]\nWe want to understand your thoughts on some important issues in the news today. Please read the short news article below.\nLeading analysts believe that an “AI arms race” is beginning, in which the U.S. and China are investing billions of dollars to develop powerful AI systems for surveillance, autonomous weapons, cyber operations, propaganda, and command and control systems.\n[Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups listed below.]\n\nB.10.1 Control\n[No additional text.]\n\n\nB.10.2 Nationalism treatment\nSome leaders in the U.S. military and tech industry argue that the U.S. government should invest much more resources in AI research to ensure that the U.S.’s AI capabilities stay ahead of China’s. Furthermore, they argue that the U.S. government should partner with American tech companies to develop advanced AI systems, particularly for military use.\nAccording to a leaked memo produced by a senior National Security Council official, China has “assembled the basic components required for winning the Al arms race…Much like America’s success in the competition for nuclear weapons, China’s 21st Century Manhattan Project sets them on a path to getting there first.”\n\n\nB.10.3 War risks treatment\nSome prominent thinkers are concerned that a U.S.-China arms race could lead to extreme dangers. To stay ahead, the U.S. and China may race to deploy advanced military AI systems that they do not fully understand or can control. We could see catastrophic accidents, such as a rapid, automated escalation involving cyber and nuclear weapons.\n“Competition for AI superiority at [the] national level [is the] most likely cause of World War Three,” warned Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n\nB.10.4 Common humanity treatment\nSome prominent thinkers are concerned that a U.S.-China arms race could lead to extreme dangers. To stay ahead, the U.S. and China may race to deploy advanced military AI systems that they do not fully understand or can control. We could see catastrophic accidents, such as a rapid, automated escalation involving cyber and nuclear weapons.\n“Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons,” warned the late Stephen Hawking, one of the world’s most prominent physicists. At the same time, he said that with proper management of the technology, researchers “can create AI for the good of the world.”\n[The order of the next two questions is randomized.]\nQUESTION:\nHow much do you agree or disagree with the following statement?\nThe U.S. should invest more in AI military capabilities to make sure it doesn’t fall behind China’s, even if doing so may exacerbate the arms race. For instance, the U.S. could increase AI research funding for the military and universities. It could also collaborate with American tech companies to develop AI for military use.\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nStrongly agree (2)\nSomewhat agree (1)\nNeither agree nor disagree (0)\nSomewhat disagree (-1)\nStrongly disagree (-2)\nI don’t know\n\nQUESTION:\nHow much do you agree or disagree with the following statement?\nThe U.S. should work hard to cooperate with China to avoid the dangers of an AI arms race, even if doing so requires giving up some of the U.S.’s advantages. Cooperation could include collaborations between American and Chinese AI research labs, or the U.S. and China creating and committing to common safety standards.\nANSWER CHOICES:\n\nStrongly agree (2)\nSomewhat agree (1)\nNeither agree nor disagree (0)\nSomewhat disagree (-1)\nStrongly disagree (-2)\nI don’t know"

Experimental Texts (Control vs. Intervention)\nParticipants were randomly assigned to read one of two texts.\n\nInstructions Before Reading Text (From Appendix B, Page 28)\nBefore you start solving math puzzles with ChatGPT, please read the following text, which aims to briefly introduce ChatGPT. Please read the text carefully and thoughtfully, even if you have previously encountered and used ChatGPT. Once you have read the text, click the “Next” button in the bottom right corner of the page.\n\n\nControl Group Text (Appendix B, Page 28)\nA short introduction to ChatGPT\nChatGPT is a chatbot that was first introduced in 2022 and has since gained rapid popularity. It has been widely adopted in various fields, such as education, economics, customer service, and science, where its use has significantly simplified many tasks.\nChatGPT operates based on user input, which can include questions, tasks, or mathematical operations. It analyzes the user’s input and generates an output presented in an understandable language. With ChatGPT, it is possible to solve various tasks, from simple questions to extensive projects. For example, ChatGPT can help generate original text, translate, analyze data, write code, and summarize large amounts of material.\nHere are some reasons why ChatGPT is a useful tool for solving language-related tasks¹:\n\nUnderstanding language. ChatGPT generates outputs that take into account the context and meaning of words effectively.\nPersonalized responses. ChatGPT can adapt its responses based on the user’s style and previous inputs. This feature enhances the user experience by aligning outputs better with the user’s needs.\nAvailability. As long as there is an internet connection, ChatGPT is always accessible. Its accessibility also extends to its ability to understand and generate responses in multiple languages, including Estonian.\nAutomation. ChatGPT helps simplify and automate routine tasks, saving the user time and effort\n\n— End of Control Text —\n\n\nIntervention Group Text (Appendix B, Pages 28-33)\n(The intervention group read the Control Group Text above, PLUS the following sections):\nChatGPT working mechanism\nEach time ChatGPT generates an output, it solves a very simple task: predicting the next word. For example, if I write the sentence “The dog is ___” and ask you which word fits best in the blank, you would likely suggest words such as “an animal,” “furry,” or “loyal.” On the other hand, words like “bottle,” “blue,” or “fish” would be less likely to fit.\nJust as you intuitively know which words are more probable in a given context, ChatGPT also determines this based on its prior training. It has been trained using almost all publicly available text from the internet, allowing it to learn how words are related and which words are most likely to follow others.\nHowever, it’s important to note that ChatGPT does not think or experience the world like humans do. At its core, it is simply an extremely large statistical model that responds to user input by calculating the probabilities of the next words.\nWriting prompts\nAs previously described, ChatGPT generates outputs based on user input. This input can consist of four main components²:\n\nInstructions. This part explains what task you want ChatGPT to perform. Some examples include: “solve, calculate, write, summarize, evaluate, explain, recommend.”\nContext. Context provides additional external information that helps ChatGPT better understand the task or the content of the text. This allows it to generate more relevant and accurate outputs.\nText. This is the core content of the input, such as a specific description of an essay you want ChatGPT to write or a passage of text that you want it to summarize.\nOutput preferences. This allows you to specify the format or style of the response. For example, you can set the word count, paragraph length, or request an output in bullet points.\n\nUser input does not have to include all four components. For instance, if you type “If a = b and b = c, then…”, ChatGPT will understand that the instruction is to “solve” without needing explicit clarification. However, if you want ChatGPT to generate similar logic problems instead, you need to specify your instructions more clearly.\nFor any given input, it is useful to consider these components and assess what information ChatGPT might need to produce the most appropriate output.\nFrequent errors in prompts³\n\nUnclear input. Sometimes, user input is not specific enough, resulting in a response that is too broad or general. For example, the prompt “Describe how artificial intelligence has changed the world” is too vague if we specifically want to know about the risks and challenges ChatGPT has caused in the education system.\nComplex and conflicting instructions. If instructions are too complicated or contradictory, ChatGPT may struggle to interpret them correctly. An example of conflicting input would be: “Write an essay on technological developments in the 20th century that is detailed enough to be interesting for a computer scientist but also simple enough for a five-year-old to understand.”\nBiased input. User input can be biased in various ways. For instance, if we want ChatGPT to evaluate the style of a written text, asking, “Is the following text well-written in terms of style?” may nudge ChatGPT towards answering “Yes.” A better approach would be to ask neutrally: “Evaluate the style of the following text and provide suggestions for improvement.”\n\nChatGPT Limitations and risks\nAlthough properly formulating input is crucial for obtaining the best possible response, there are some tasks where ChatGPT may still provide incorrect answers, even if the user input is well-structured. Below is a summary of key limitations of ChatGPT, along with examples.\n\nDrawing conclusions about the real world. ChatGPT does not have direct contact with the real world. Instead, it relies solely on the texts it has been trained on to make inferences about reality. This sometimes leads to mistakes when solving tasks that require reasoning about real-world objects and their properties.\n\nIf I have 5 apples right now, but last week I ate 2 apples, then how many do I have left?\nChatGPT response simulation: If you originally had 5 apples and last week you ate 2 apples, then you have left: 5 - 2 = 3 apples.\n\nExample 1. In the above example, ChatGPT misunderstands the concept of time (now, last week) and mistakenly assumes that it is a simple arithmetic problem⁴.\nMathematical and logical reasoning. ChatGPT may sometimes incorrectly solve even simple problems that require mathematical and logical reasoning.\n\nHow many words and how many numbers are in the following list: cat, 10, dog, 60, cow, 40, squirrel, 70, spruce, 15, book, 32.\nChatGPT response simulation: The list contains 7 words and 5 numbers.\n\nExample 2. (No error noted by authors here, seems correct)\n\nThe five given cards must be arranged in such a way that the resulting 9-digit number is the smallest possible. Which of these cards must be the rightmost in this case? The cards are: 4, 8, 31, 59, 107.\nChatGPT response simulation: To form the smallest possible 9-digit number, the cards must be placed in ascending order, considering the value of each number:\n\nThe smallest number is 4, followed by 8, then 31, then 59, and finally, the largest number, 107. If we arrange these to create the smallest number, it is logical that the largest card, 107, must be the rightmost, as placing it at the last position increases the overall value the least. Answer: The rightmost card must be 107.\n\n\nExample 3⁵. Actually, 107 should be the leftmost number, and 8 should be the rightmost number.\nHallucination. ChatGPT sometimes produces completely fabricated information – a phenomenon known as hallucination. This can include generating false references and historical facts. Additionally, it may struggle to distinguish between fiction and reality.\n\nWho was Estonia’s first Olympic silver medalist?\nChatGPT response simulation: Estonia’s first Olympic silver medalist was Jaan Tõnisson, who won the silver medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. Tõnisson competed in Greco-Roman wrestling in the heavyweight category.\n\nExample 4. Estonia’s first Olympic silver medalist was Martin Klein in 1912, and Jaan Tõnisson was not a wrestler but an important statesman. ChatGPT can hallucinate in response to various types of questions. However, it is especially easy to trigger this when user instructions require a very narrow and specific output.\n\nName five cities in Harju County that start and end with the same letter.\nChatGPT response simulation: There are five cities in Harju County that start and end with the same letter:\n\nKeila\nSaue\nMaardu\nPaldiski\nJõelähtme\n\n\nExample 5. (Authors don’t explicitly state error here, but Jõelähtme is not a city and doesn’t fit the criterion. Paldiski also doesn’t fit.)\n\nAnswer with one word: In which sport did Napoleon win a gold medal at the 1980 Olympic Games?\nChatGPT response simulation: Football.\n\nExample 6. (Napoleon was long dead by 1980; this is a hallucination.)\nDiscriminatory Outputs. ChatGPT’s outputs depend on the texts it was trained on. These texts may contain various social biases related to people’s social status, gender, race, and age, and during training, the AI learns to incorporate these biases into its outputs. As a result, ChatGPT’s responses may be politically biased or include gender stereotypes that exist in society.\n\nThe CEO of a large company went to the restroom before going to the manicurist. The men’s and women’s restrooms were separate. Which restroom did they go to?\nChatGPT response simulation: Based on the sentence, we can infer that the CEO is a man because, in such contexts, when gender is not explicitly specified and the general term “CEO” is used, it is often assumed to refer to a man. Therefore, they went to the men’s restroom. If this sentence is part of a story and you want to provide a clearer answer, it could depend on additional context or the explicitly stated gender of the character. In this case, the assumption would be that they used the men’s restroom.\n\nExample 7. (Demonstrates gender bias assumption).\n\nIn addition to knowing that ChatGPT can make mistakes, it is important to understand that some of its characteristics make detecting these errors difficult.\n\nExcessive confidence. ChatGPT presents outputs with high confidence, even when they contain misinformation. Instead of saying, “I’m not sure,” it delivers responses in a very convincing and fluent manner, making it harder to notice errors in its outputs.\nErrors are unexpected. ChatGPT’s mistakes can appear unpredictably, which often makes them go unnoticed. It may clearly and accurately explain complex quantum physics concepts one moment and then make mistakes in the simplest logic problems the next. This inconsistency in response quality poses a risk when using ChatGPT. Based on previous correct answers, we might assume that ChatGPT can correctly solve subsequent tasks—even when those responses actually contain errors.\n\nTips for Using ChatGPT\n\nAsk multiple times. ChatGPT’s responses are based on probability calculations, meaning it may provide different answers to the same question. Some of these answers might be unlikely or incorrect. Therefore, it is helpful to ask the same question multiple times with slightly different wording so you can choose the most suitable response.\nAsk for the reasoning. When solving problems that require logical thinking, include an instruction in your input asking ChatGPT to explain its reasoning (e.g., by adding “Solve step by step” at the end of your prompt). This makes it easier to understand how ChatGPT arrived at its answer and helps identify if the reasoning is flawed.\nVerify facts. If you’re unsure whether the information in ChatGPT’s response is accurate, always verify it using other sources. One option is to search on Google. Another is to ask ChatGPT to provide references in its output so you can check their reliability yourself.\n\nRemember that ChatGPT is a tool, not a replacement for thinking.\n— End of Intervention Text —\nFootnotes for Appendix B text: ¹ Taken from Hariri (2024) ² Taken from DAIR.AI (2023) ³ Taken from Giray (2023) ⁴ Task inspired by Diaz (2024) ⁵ Taken from Teaduskool (2022)"

There is no time limit for answering.”\n\n\nPuzzle Presentation and Interaction (Pages 6-7, Figure 1, Appendix A)\nFor each of the 8 puzzles (4 with correct ChatGPT recommendations, 4 with incorrect), participants saw the following:\n\nPuzzle Text: The math puzzle question was displayed. (See Appendix A below for texts).\nChatGPT Recommendation: A screenshot of ChatGPT’s recommendation (including its reasoning and final answer) was shown below the puzzle text. (See Appendix A below for recommendations).\nReliance Decision Question:\n\nDo you use ChatGPT’s recommendation?\n\n( ) Yes\n( ) No\n\n\nOutcome based on Reliance Decision:\n\nIf “Yes”: The participant was considered to have adopted ChatGPT’s answer. They proceeded directly to the Confidence Rating for this puzzle.\nIf “No”: The participant was given the opportunity to solve the puzzle independently. They were presented with four multiple-choice answer options for the puzzle. Crucially, ChatGPT’s suggested answer (from the screenshot) was removed from these options. (The specific alternative options presented when ‘No’ was chosen are not listed in the paper’s Appendix A, only the options available if ChatGPT’s answer was included conceptually). The participant selected one of these options. They then proceeded to the Confidence Rating.\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Rating (After Each Puzzle) (Page 6)\nAfter submitting their answer (either by choosing “Yes” to the recommendation or by choosing an answer after selecting “No”), participants rated their confidence:\n\nStatement: “I believe my answer to the previous puzzle was correct.”\nScale: Five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree – 5 = strongly agree)\n\n( ) 1\n( ) 2\n( ) 3\n( ) 4\n( ) 5"

    "text": "Appendix A: Math Puzzles and ChatGPT Recommendations\n(Approximate English translations from Estonian original)\n\nCorrect 1\n\nPuzzle Text: There’s three rooms, one of which contains a hidden lion. The door of the first room has a sign that says, “The lion is here.” The door of the second room has a sign that says, “The lion is not here.” The door of the third room has a sign that says, “3² – 2³ = 2³ - 3².” Only one of the signs is true. In which room is the lion?\nChatGPT recommendation: &gt; Let’s analyze the statements on each room’s sign: &gt; 1. First room: “The lion is here.” &gt; * If this is true, then the second sign (“The lion is not here”) must be false, creating a contradiction. It cannot be true. &gt; 2. Second room: “The lion is not here.” &gt; * If this is true, then the lion is neither in this room nor in the first room. The lion must be in the third room. &gt; * The sign on the third room, 3² - 2³ = 2³ - 3², is not correct (1 ≠ -1), which means that sign is false. Only this sign can be true. &gt; 3. Third room: 3² - 2³ = 2³ - 3². &gt; * The equation is not true. It cannot be correct. &gt; Conclusion: The second room’s sign is true, so the lion is in the third room.\nAnswer options (Conceptual): in the first room, in the second room, the lion can be in any room, the lion can be in either the first or the second room. (Note: If participant chose ‘No’, one of these options corresponding to the third room would be presented alongside three others.)\nCorrect answer: in the third room.\n\n\n\nCorrect 2\n\nPuzzle Text: Mikk is buying a sports club membership for the next month, allowing him to train on two days per week. He must immediately choose the two weekdays on which he will attend training. How many different ways can he choose these two days, given that he does not want to train on two consecutive days?\nChatGPT recommendation: &gt; First, we calculate all possible combinations of two days in a week: &gt; (⁷₂) = 21 &gt; The pairs of consecutive days are: &gt; (Monday, Tuesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday), (Wednesday, Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday), (Saturday, Sunday), (Sunday, Monday) — a total of 7 pairs. &gt; We subtract the consecutive pairs from all combinations: &gt; 21 - 7 = 14 &gt; Thus, the number of possible choices is: &gt; 14\nAnswer options (Conceptual): 16, 12, 10, 8 (Note: If participant chose ‘No’, 14 would be removed, and they would choose from these four.)\nCorrect answer: 14\n\n\n\nCorrect 3\n\nPuzzle Text: Among the boys in the class, no two were born on the same day of the week, and among the girls in the class, no two were born in the same calendar month. If a new student were to join the class, one of these conditions would no longer be met. How many students are currently in the class?\nChatGPT recommendation: &gt; Let there be b boys and g girls in the class. The following two conditions are given: &gt; 1. No boys in the class were born on the same day of the week. &gt; 2. No girls in the class were born in the same calendar month. &gt; Since no boys can be born on the same day of the week, the maximum number of boys is 7 (as there are 7 days in a week). Since no girls can be born in the same calendar month, the maximum number of girls is 12 (as there are 12 months in a year). &gt; If a new student were to join the class, one of these conditions would no longer be met. This means that the current number of boys and girls in the class is at its maximum under these conditions. &gt; The maximum number of boys is 7 (since more boys would mean that at least two were born on the same day of the week), and the maximum number of girls is 12 (since more girls would mean that at least two were born in the same calendar month). &gt; Thus, there are currently 19 students in the class.\nAnswer options (Conceptual): 18, 20, 24, 25 (Note: If participant chose ‘No’, 19 would be removed.)\nCorrect answer: 19\n\n\n\nCorrect 4\n\nPuzzle Text: The teacher asked five of their students how many of them had studied at home the previous day. Pelle said that no one had studied, Elle said that only one person had studied, Mikk said that two had studied, Riho said that three had studied, and Karl said that four had studied. The teacher knew that the students who had not actually studied at home were lying, while those who had studied were telling the truth. How many of these five students had actually studied at home the previous day?\nChatGPT recommendation: &gt; Let x be the number of students who studied at home. Pelle said that 0 studied, Elle said that 1 studied, Mikk said that 2 studied, Riho said that 3 studied, and Karl said that 4 studied. &gt; If x = 0, Pelle is telling the truth (1 truth, 4 lying). This doesn’t work because everyone else would have to be lying. &gt; If x = 1, Elle is telling the truth (1 truth, 4 lying), which works because one is telling the truth and the rest are lying. &gt; If x = 2, Mikk is telling the truth (2 truth, 3 lying), but this doesn’t work since there should be 2 truthful and 3 lying. &gt; If x = 3, Riho is telling the truth (3 truth, 2 lying), which doesn’t work as there should be 3 truthful and 2 lying. &gt; If x = 4, Karl is telling the truth (4 truth, 1 lying), which also doesn’t work as there should be 4 truthful and 1 lying. &gt; The only possible solution is x = 1, meaning that 1 student studied at home the previous day.\nAnswer options (Conceptual): 0, 2, 3, 4 (Note: If participant chose ‘No’, 1 would be removed.)\nCorrect answer: 1\n\n\n\nIncorrect 1\n\nPuzzle Text: Anni, Pille, Kati, Tiina, and Eerika attended a meeting. Each of them greeted only their acquaintances with a single hug at the beginning. In total, Anni hugged once, Pille hugged twice, Kati hugged three times, and Tiina hugged four times. How many times did Eerika hug? (Note: Each hug is mutual).\nChatGPT recommendation: &gt; Let A, P, K, T, and E represent Anni, Pille, Kati, Tiina, and Eerika, respectively. Each person hugs only their acquaintances, meaning every hug is mutual. &gt; We know that the number of hugs each person gave is as follows: A = 1, P = 2, K = 3, T = 4. &gt; Now, we calculate the total number of hugs. If x is the number of hugs Eerika gave, then: &gt; 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + x = 2 × total mutual hugs &gt; Total number of hugs: &gt; 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + x = 10 + x &gt; Since every hug is mutual, we divide the total number of hugs by two: &gt; (10 + x) / 2 &gt; Since each person could only hug their acquaintances, x must be between 0 and 4. The only valid solution is x = 0. &gt; Thus, Eerika hugged 0 times.\nAnswer options (Conceptual): 5, 4, 3, 2 (Note: If participant chose ‘No’, 0 would be removed.)\nCorrect answer: 2 times\nChatGPT’s error: The task states that there are five people (Anni, Pille, Kati, Tiina, Eerika). Tiina hugged four times. Since hugs are mutual and Tiina only hugs acquaintances, she must know all four other people. Eerika must therefore be one of the people Tiina hugged. Eerika must have hugged at least once (Tiina). ChatGPT claims 0, incorrectly deducing x must be between 0 and 4, and incorrectly solving the handshake problem logic (the sum of degrees must be even, 1+2+3+4+x = 10+x must be even, so x can be 0, 2, or 4. With T=4 hugging everyone else, E must hug T, so x&gt;=1. Thus x=2 or x=4. A graph drawing confirms x=2).\n\n\n\nIncorrect 2\n\nPuzzle Text: Emma, Ivi, Rita, and Siiri have ages of 3, 8, 12, and 14 years in some order. Both the sum of Siiri and Emma’s ages and the sum of Siiri and Rita’s ages are divisible by 5. Find the sum of Siiri and Ivi’s ages.\nChatGPT recommendation: &gt; The given ages of Emma, Ivi, Rita, and Siiri are 3, 8, 12, and 14 years. We have two conditions: &gt; 1. The sum of Siiri and Emma’s ages is divisible by 5. &gt; 2. The sum of Siiri and Rita’s ages is divisible by 5. &gt; Let’s check all possible ages for Siiri: &gt; 1. Siiri = 3: 3 + X and 3 + Y do not give results divisible by 5. &gt; 2. Siiri = 8: 8 + X and 8 + Y do not give results divisible by 5. &gt; 3. Siiri = 12: 12 + X and 12 + Y do not give results divisible by 5. &gt; 4. Siiri = 14: &gt; * 14 + X and 14 + Y are divisible by 5 only if X = 12 and Y = 6. &gt; * Thus, Emma = 12 and Rita = 8. &gt; Siiri and Ivi’s ages are 14 and 3. Their sum is 17. &gt; Answer: 17.\nAnswer options (Conceptual): 26, 22, 20, 15 (Note: If participant chose ‘No’, 17 would be removed.)\nCorrect answer: 26\nChatGPT’s error: ChatGPT incorrectly dismisses Siiri = 3, 8, 12. Let’s test Siiri=12. Possible pairs summing to a multiple of 5 with 12 are (12+3=15) and (12+8=20). So, if Siiri=12, Emma=3, Rita=8 (or vice versa). Then Ivi must be 14. The sum of Siiri (12) and Ivi (14) is 26. ChatGPT’s check for Siiri=14 is flawed: it requires Y=6, which is not one of the available ages (3, 8, 12, 14). It then claims Rita=8 without justification for the change from 6.\n\n\n\nIncorrect 3\n\nPuzzle Text: Tiit is convinced that his clock is 5 minutes fast, but in reality, his clock is 10 minutes slow. Leo is convinced that his clock is 10 minutes slow, but in reality, his clock is 5 minutes fast. At one moment, both of them look at their clocks, and Tiit believes that the correct time is 12:00. What does Leo think the correct time is at that moment?\nChatGPT recommendation: &gt; Tiit believes that his clock is 5 minutes fast, but in reality, his clock is 10 minutes slow. So, if Tiit thinks the correct time is 12:00, then according to his clock, the time is: &gt; 12:00 - 5 minutes = 11:55 &gt; Since his clock is actually 10 minutes slow, the real time is: &gt; 11:55 + 10 minutes = 12:05 &gt; Now let’s check Leo’s clock. Leo believes that his clock is 10 minutes slow, but in reality, his clock is 5 minutes fast. When Leo looks at his clock, the time he sees is: &gt; Actual time - 10 minutes = 12:05 - 10 minutes = 11:55 &gt; Since Leo’s clock is actually 5 minutes fast, the time on his clock is: &gt; 11:55 - 5 minutes = 11:50 &gt; Thus, if Tiit thinks the correct time is 12:00, then Leo believes the correct time at that moment is 11:50.\nAnswer options (Conceptual): 11:30, 11:45, 12:00, 12:30 (Note: If participant chose ‘No’, 11:50 would be removed.)\nCorrect answer: 12:30\nChatGPT’s error: Initial step is wrong. If Tiit believes the correct time is 12:00 and believes his clock is 5 minutes fast, his clock must show 12:05 (because he would subtract 5 mins from his clock reading to get his believed time). Since his clock is actually 10 minutes slow, the real time is 12:05 + 10 minutes = 12:15. Leo’s clock is actually 5 minutes fast, so it shows 12:15 + 5 minutes = 12:20. Leo believes his clock is 10 minutes slow, so he believes the correct time is 12:20 + 10 minutes = 12:30.\n\n\n\nIncorrect 4\n\nPuzzle Text: An old-fashioned scale is not working correctly. If the weighted item is lighter than 1000 g, the scale shows the correct weight; otherwise, it displays a random number greater than 1000. Five objects, A, B, C, D, and E, were all lighter than 1000 g. The objects were weighed in pairs, and the scale readings were recorded as follows: B + D = 1200, C + E = 2100, B + E = 800, B + C = 900, and A + E = 700. Which of these objects was the heaviest?\nChatGPT recommendation: &gt; We have five objects: A, B, C, D, and E, all weighing less than 1000 g. When weighed in pairs, the recorded results were: &gt; B + D = 1200, C + E = 2100, B + E = 800, B + C = 900, A + E = 700. &gt; The valid equations are: B + E = 800, B + C = 900, A + E = 700. Since B + E = 800 and B + C = 900, it follows that C = 100. &gt; Substituting into A + E = 700: A + (800 - B) = 700, we get A = -100 + B. &gt; Finally, we solve: (900 - B) + (800 - B) = 2100, which results in B = -200. &gt; Thus, E is the heaviest object.\nAnswer options (Conceptual): A, B, C, D (Note: If participant chose ‘No’, E would be removed.)\nCorrect answer: D\nChatGPT’s error: ChatGPT correctly identifies the valid equations (where sum &lt; 1000 is implied, but the scale shows correct weight regardless since individual items &lt; 1000g means pairs could be &lt; 1000g or &gt; 1000g. It only shows correct weight if item &lt; 1000g. This rule seems misstated or misinterpreted. Let’s assume the equations B+E=800, B+C=900, A+E=700 are correct weights because sum &lt; 1000). From B+E=800 and B+C=900, we can infer C = E + 100. From A+E=700, A = 700-E. From B+E=800, B=800-E. Since B+C=900, (800-E) + (E+100) = 900, which is 900=900, consistent. Now consider B+D=1200 and C+E=2100. These sums are &gt;1000, so the scale reading is random and &gt;1000. These equations give no info. We have weights in terms of E: A=700-E, B=800-E, C=100+E, D=?, E=E. All weights must be positive. So 700-E&gt;0 (E&lt;700) and 800-E&gt;0 (E&lt;800). Also E&gt;0. So 0 &lt; E &lt; 700. We need to find the heaviest. Can we deduce D? No information. ChatGPT’s calculation leading to C=100 is wrong (it should be C=E+100). Its calculation A=-100+B is wrong (should be A=700-E). Its final solve step (900 - B) + (800 - B) = 2100 is mixing valid equations (B+C=900 implies C=900-B) with an invalid one (C+E=2100, which should be ignored). Its result B=-200 is impossible. It incorrectly concludes E is heaviest. The actual solution requires careful deduction: B+E=800, B+C=900 -&gt; C &gt; E. A+E=700, B+E=800 -&gt; B &gt; A. B+C=900. Max possible sum of two items &lt; 1000g is slightly less than 2000g. B+D=1200, C+E=2100. Since C+E &gt; 2000 (impossible if both &lt;1000), the 2100 reading is random. B+D=1200 must be the actual sum B+D=1200. Since B&lt;1000, D must be &gt;200. We have B=800-E, C=E+100, A=700-E. Weights are (700-E, 800-E, E+100, D, E). Since B+D=1200, D=1200-B = 1200-(800-E) = 400+E. The weights are (700-E, 800-E, 100+E, 400+E, E). Comparing these: D &gt; B &gt; A. D &gt; C if 400+E &gt; 100+E (true). D &gt; E if 400+E &gt; E (true). So D is the heaviest.\n\n\n\n\n:::{#quarto-navigation-envelope .hidden}\n[Energy AI Study]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1zaWRlYmFyLXRpdGxl\"}\n[Energy AI Study]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXItdGl0bGU=\"}\n[Task]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXI6VGFzaw==\"}\n[/task.html]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXI6L3Rhc2suaHRtbA==\"}\n[Item_Inspector]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXI6SXRlbV9JbnNwZWN0b3I=\"}\n[/inspector.html]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXI6L2luc3BlY3Rvci5odG1s\"}\n[Dash]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXI6RGFzaA==\"}\n[/survey_dash.html]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXI6L3N1cnZleV9kYXNoLmh0bWw=\"}\n[Slides]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXI6U2xpZGVz\"}\n[/proposals/prop_slides.html]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXI6L3Byb3Bvc2Fscy9wcm9wX3NsaWRlcy5odG1s\"}\n[https://github.com/tegorman13/llm_energy_task]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1uYXZiYXI6aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3RlZ29ybWFuMTMvbGxtX2VuZXJneV90YXNr\"}\n\n:::{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"Zm9vdGVyLWxlZnQ=\"}\n© 2024 [Thomas Gorman](https://tegorman13.github.io)\n:::\n\n\n:::{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"Zm9vdGVyLWNlbnRlcg==\"}\nsite made with [](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)\n:::\n\n\n:::{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"Zm9vdGVyLXJpZ2h0LWh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS90ZWdvcm1hbjEzL2xsbV9lbmVyZ3lfdGFzaw==\"}\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{#quarto-meta-markdown .hidden}\n[Energy AI Study]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLW1ldGF0aXRsZQ==\"}\n[Energy AI Study]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLXR3aXR0ZXJjYXJkdGl0bGU=\"}\n[Energy AI Study]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLW9nY2FyZHRpdGxl\"}\n[Energy AI Study]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLW1ldGFzaXRlbmFtZQ==\"}\n[]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLXR3aXR0ZXJjYXJkZGVzYw==\"}\n[]{.hidden .quarto-markdown-envelope-contents render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLW9nY2FyZGRkZXNj\"}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\n\n::: {.quarto-embedded-source-code}\n```````````````````{.markdown shortcodes=\"false\"}\n# Puppart & Aru (2025) AI Literacy Intervention Study\n\nPuppart, B., & Aru, J. (2025). Short-term AI literacy intervention does not reduce over-reliance on incorrect ChatGPT recommendations (No. arXiv:2503.10556). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.10556\n\n\n## Study Overview\n\nThis document outlines the questionnaires, informational texts, and task prompts used in the study by Puppart & Aru (2025) investigating the effect of an AI literacy intervention on over-reliance on ChatGPT among high school students. Participants were randomly assigned to a control or intervention group, read corresponding texts, answered self-assessment questions, and then solved math puzzles with presented ChatGPT recommendations.\n\n*Note: The study was conducted online via LimeSurvey. Informed consent was obtained first, and a debriefing occurred afterward. The exact wording of the consent form and debriefing text is not provided in the paper.*\n\n## 1. Demographic Information\n\nParticipants were asked to provide the following demographic information (Page 5):\n\n*   Gender\n*   Age\n*   School affiliation\n\n## 2. Experimental Texts (Control vs. Intervention)\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to read one of two texts.\n\n### Instructions Before Reading Text (From Appendix B, Page 28)\n\nBefore you start solving math puzzles with ChatGPT, please read the following text, which aims to briefly introduce ChatGPT. Please read the text carefully and thoughtfully, even if you have previously encountered and used ChatGPT. Once you have read the text, click the \"Next\" button in the bottom right corner of the page.\n\n### Control Group Text (Appendix B, Page 28)\n\n**A short introduction to ChatGPT**\n\nChatGPT is a chatbot that was first introduced in 2022 and has since gained rapid popularity. It has been widely adopted in various fields, such as education, economics, customer service, and science, where its use has significantly simplified many tasks.\n\nChatGPT operates based on user input, which can include questions, tasks, or mathematical operations. It analyzes the user's input and generates an output presented in an understandable language. With ChatGPT, it is possible to solve various tasks, from simple questions to extensive projects. For example, ChatGPT can help generate original text, translate, analyze data, write code, and summarize large amounts of material.\n\nHere are some reasons why ChatGPT is a useful tool for solving language-related tasks¹:\n\n*   **Understanding language.** ChatGPT generates outputs that take into account the context and meaning of words effectively.\n*   **Personalized responses.** ChatGPT can adapt its responses based on the user's style and previous inputs. This feature enhances the user experience by aligning outputs better with the user's needs.\n*   **Availability.** As long as there is an internet connection, ChatGPT is always accessible. Its accessibility also extends to its ability to understand and generate responses in multiple languages, including Estonian.\n*   **Automation.** ChatGPT helps simplify and automate routine tasks, saving the user time and effort\n\n--- *End of Control Text* ---\n\n### Intervention Group Text (Appendix B, Pages 28-33)\n\n*(The intervention group read the Control Group Text above, PLUS the following sections):*\n\n**ChatGPT working mechanism**\n\nEach time ChatGPT generates an output, it solves a very simple task: predicting the next word. For example, if I write the sentence \"The dog is \\_\\_\\_\" and ask you which word fits best in the blank, you would likely suggest words such as \"an animal,\" \"furry,\" or \"loyal.\" On the other hand, words like \"bottle,\" \"blue,\" or \"fish\" would be less likely to fit.\n\nJust as you intuitively know which words are more probable in a given context, ChatGPT also determines this based on its prior training. It has been trained using almost all publicly available text from the internet, allowing it to learn how words are related and which words are most likely to follow others.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that ChatGPT does not think or experience the world like humans do. At its core, it is simply an extremely large statistical model that responds to user input by calculating the probabilities of the next words.\n\n**Writing prompts**\n\nAs previously described, ChatGPT generates outputs based on user input. This input can consist of four main components²:\n\n*   **Instructions.** This part explains what task you want ChatGPT to perform. Some examples include: \"solve, calculate, write, summarize, evaluate, explain, recommend.\"\n*   **Context.** Context provides additional external information that helps ChatGPT better understand the task or the content of the text. This allows it to generate more relevant and accurate outputs.\n*   **Text.** This is the core content of the input, such as a specific description of an essay you want ChatGPT to write or a passage of text that you want it to summarize.\n*   **Output preferences.** This allows you to specify the format or style of the response. For example, you can set the word count, paragraph length, or request an output in bullet points.\n\nUser input does not have to include all four components. For instance, if you type \"If a = b and b = c, then...\", ChatGPT will understand that the instruction is to \"solve\" without needing explicit clarification. However, if you want ChatGPT to generate similar logic problems instead, you need to specify your instructions more clearly.\n\nFor any given input, it is useful to consider these components and assess what information ChatGPT might need to produce the most appropriate output.\n\n**Frequent errors in prompts³**\n\n*   **Unclear input.** Sometimes, user input is not specific enough, resulting in a response that is too broad or general. For example, the prompt \"Describe how artificial intelligence has changed the world\" is too vague if we specifically want to know about the risks and challenges ChatGPT has caused in the education system.\n*   **Complex and conflicting instructions.** If instructions are too complicated or contradictory, ChatGPT may struggle to interpret them correctly. An example of conflicting input would be: \"Write an essay on technological developments in the 20th century that is detailed enough to be interesting for a computer scientist but also simple enough for a five-year-old to understand.\"\n*   **Biased input.** User input can be biased in various ways. For instance, if we want ChatGPT to evaluate the style of a written text, asking, \"Is the following text well-written in terms of style?\" may nudge ChatGPT towards answering \"Yes.\" A better approach would be to ask neutrally: \"Evaluate the style of the following text and provide suggestions for improvement.\"\n\n**ChatGPT Limitations and risks**\n\nAlthough properly formulating input is crucial for obtaining the best possible response, there are some tasks where ChatGPT may still provide incorrect answers, even if the user input is well-structured. Below is a summary of key limitations of ChatGPT, along with examples.\n\n*   **Drawing conclusions about the real world.** ChatGPT does not have direct contact with the real world. Instead, it relies solely on the texts it has been trained on to make inferences about reality. This sometimes leads to mistakes when solving tasks that require reasoning about real-world objects and their properties.\n\n    &gt; If I have 5 apples right now, but last week I ate 2 apples, then how many do I have left?\n    &gt;\n    &gt; *ChatGPT response simulation:*\n    &gt; If you originally had 5 apples and last week you ate 2 apples, then you have left:\n    &gt; 5 - 2 = 3 apples.\n\n    *Example 1.* In the above example, ChatGPT misunderstands the concept of time (now, last week) and mistakenly assumes that it is a simple arithmetic problem⁴.\n\n*   **Mathematical and logical reasoning.** ChatGPT may sometimes incorrectly solve even simple problems that require mathematical and logical reasoning.\n\n    &gt; How many words and how many numbers are in the following list:\n    &gt; cat, 10, dog, 60, cow, 40, squirrel, 70, spruce, 15, book, 32.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; *ChatGPT response simulation:*\n    &gt; The list contains 7 words and 5 numbers.\n\n    *Example 2.* (No error noted by authors here, seems correct)\n\n    &gt; The five given cards must be arranged in such a way that the resulting 9-digit number is the smallest possible. Which of these cards must be the rightmost in this case? The cards are: 4, 8, 31, 59, 107.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; *ChatGPT response simulation:*\n    &gt; To form the smallest possible 9-digit number, the cards must be placed in ascending order, considering the value of each number:\n    &gt; *   The smallest number is 4, followed by 8, then 31, then 59, and finally, the largest number, 107.\n    &gt; If we arrange these to create the smallest number, it is logical that the largest card, 107, must be the rightmost, as placing it at the last position increases the overall value the least.\n    &gt; Answer: The rightmost card must be 107.\n\n    *Example 3⁵.* Actually, 107 should be the leftmost number, and 8 should be the rightmost number.\n\n*   **Hallucination.** ChatGPT sometimes produces completely fabricated information – a phenomenon known as hallucination. This can include generating false references and historical facts. Additionally, it may struggle to distinguish between fiction and reality.\n\n    &gt; Who was Estonia's first Olympic silver medalist?\n    &gt;\n    &gt; *ChatGPT response simulation:*\n    &gt; Estonia's first Olympic silver medalist was Jaan Tõnisson, who won the silver medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. Tõnisson competed in Greco-Roman wrestling in the heavyweight category.\n\n    *Example 4.* Estonia's first Olympic silver medalist was Martin Klein in 1912, and Jaan Tõnisson was not a wrestler but an important statesman. ChatGPT can hallucinate in response to various types of questions. However, it is especially easy to trigger this when user instructions require a very narrow and specific output.\n\n    &gt; Name five cities in Harju County that start and end with the same letter.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; *ChatGPT response simulation:*\n    &gt; There are five cities in Harju County that start and end with the same letter:\n    &gt; 1. Keila\n    &gt; 2. Saue\n    &gt; 3. Maardu\n    &gt; 4. Paldiski\n    &gt; 5. Jõelähtme\n\n    *Example 5.* (Authors don't explicitly state error here, but Jõelähtme is not a city and doesn't fit the criterion. Paldiski also doesn't fit.)\n\n    &gt; Answer with one word: In which sport did Napoleon win a gold medal at the 1980 Olympic Games?\n    &gt;\n    &gt; *ChatGPT response simulation:*\n    &gt; Football.\n\n    *Example 6.* (Napoleon was long dead by 1980; this is a hallucination.)\n\n*   **Discriminatory Outputs.** ChatGPT's outputs depend on the texts it was trained on. These texts may contain various social biases related to people's social status, gender, race, and age, and during training, the AI learns to incorporate these biases into its outputs. As a result, ChatGPT's responses may be politically biased or include gender stereotypes that exist in society.\n\n    &gt; The CEO of a large company went to the restroom before going to the manicurist. The men's and women's restrooms were separate. Which restroom did they go to?\n    &gt;\n    &gt; *ChatGPT response simulation:*\n    &gt; Based on the sentence, we can infer that the CEO is a man because, in such contexts, when gender is not explicitly specified and the general term \"CEO\" is used, it is often assumed to refer to a man. Therefore, they went to the men's restroom.\n    &gt; If this sentence is part of a story and you want to provide a clearer answer, it could depend on additional context or the explicitly stated gender of the character. In this case, the assumption would be that they used the men's restroom.\n\n    *Example 7.* (Demonstrates gender bias assumption).\n\nIn addition to knowing that ChatGPT can make mistakes, it is important to understand that some of its characteristics make detecting these errors difficult.\n\n*   **Excessive confidence.** ChatGPT presents outputs with high confidence, even when they contain misinformation. Instead of saying, \"I'm not sure,\" it delivers responses in a very convincing and fluent manner, making it harder to notice errors in its outputs.\n*   **Errors are unexpected.** ChatGPT's mistakes can appear unpredictably, which often makes them go unnoticed. It may clearly and accurately explain complex quantum physics concepts one moment and then make mistakes in the simplest logic problems the next. This inconsistency in response quality poses a risk when using ChatGPT. Based on previous correct answers, we might assume that ChatGPT can correctly solve subsequent tasks—even when those responses actually contain errors.\n\n**Tips for Using ChatGPT**\n\n*   **Ask multiple times.** ChatGPT's responses are based on probability calculations, meaning it may provide different answers to the same question. Some of these answers might be unlikely or incorrect. Therefore, it is helpful to ask the same question multiple times with slightly different wording so you can choose the most suitable response.\n*   **Ask for the reasoning.** When solving problems that require logical thinking, include an instruction in your input asking ChatGPT to explain its reasoning (e.g., by adding \"Solve step by step\" at the end of your prompt). This makes it easier to understand how ChatGPT arrived at its answer and helps identify if the reasoning is flawed.\n*   **Verify facts.** If you're unsure whether the information in ChatGPT's response is accurate, always verify it using other sources. One option is to search on Google. Another is to ask ChatGPT to provide references in its output so you can check their reliability yourself.\n\n**Remember that ChatGPT is a tool, not a replacement for thinking.**\n\n--- *End of Intervention Text* ---\n\n*Footnotes for Appendix B text:*\n¹ Taken from Hariri (2024)\n² Taken from DAIR.AI (2023)\n³ Taken from Giray (2023)\n⁴ Task inspired by Diaz (2024)\n⁵ Taken from Teaduskool (2022)\n\n## 3.

Math Puzzle Task\n\n### Task Instructions (Page 6)\n\n\"You are about to solve math puzzles with the help of ChatGPT. There are a total of eight puzzles, and your goal is to answer as many correctly as possible. There is no time limit for answering.\"\n\n### Puzzle Presentation and Interaction (Pages 6-7, Figure 1, Appendix A)\n\nFor each of the 8 puzzles (4 with correct ChatGPT recommendations, 4 with incorrect), participants saw the following:\n\n1.  **Puzzle Text:** The math puzzle question was displayed. (See Appendix A below for texts).\n2.  **ChatGPT Recommendation:** A screenshot of ChatGPT's recommendation (including its reasoning and final answer) was shown below the puzzle text. (See Appendix A below for recommendations).\n3.  **Reliance Decision Question:**\n    *   **Do you use ChatGPT's recommendation?**\n        *   ( ) Yes\n        *   ( ) No\n\n4.  **Outcome based on Reliance Decision:**\n    *   **If \"Yes\":** The participant was considered to have adopted ChatGPT's answer. They proceeded directly to the Confidence Rating for this puzzle.\n    *   **If \"No\":** The participant was given the opportunity to solve the puzzle independently. They were presented with four multiple-choice answer options for the puzzle. *Crucially, ChatGPT's suggested answer (from the screenshot) was removed from these options.* (The specific alternative options presented when 'No' was chosen are not listed in the paper's Appendix A, only the options available if ChatGPT's answer *was* included conceptually). The participant selected one of these options. They then proceeded to the Confidence Rating.\n\n### Confidence Rating (After Each Puzzle) (Page 6)\n\nAfter submitting their answer (either by choosing \"Yes\" to the recommendation or by choosing an answer after selecting \"No\"), participants rated their confidence:\n\n*   **Statement:** \"I believe my answer to the previous puzzle was correct.”\n*   **Scale:** Five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree – 5 = strongly agree)\n    *   ( ) 1\n    *   ( ) 2\n    *   ( ) 3\n    *   ( ) 4\n    *   ( ) 5\n\n## Appendix A: Math Puzzles and ChatGPT Recommendations\n\n*(Approximate English translations from Estonian original)*\n\n### Correct 1\n\n*   **Puzzle Text:** There's three rooms, one of which contains a hidden lion. The door of the first room has a sign that says, \"The lion is here.\" The door of the second room has a sign that says, \"The lion is not here.\" The door of the third room has a sign that says, \"3² – 2³ = 2³ - 3².\" Only one of the signs is true. In which room is the lion?\n*   **ChatGPT recommendation:**\n    &gt; Let's analyze the statements on each room's sign:\n    &gt; 1. First room: \"The lion is here.\"\n    &gt;    *   If this is true, then the second sign (\"The lion is not here\") must be false, creating a contradiction. It cannot be true.\n    &gt; 2. Second room: \"The lion is not here.\"\n    &gt;    *   If this is true, then the lion is neither in this room nor in the first room. The lion must be in the third room.\n    &gt;    *   The sign on the third room, 3² - 2³ = 2³ - 3², is not correct (1 ≠ -1), which means that sign is false. Only this sign can be true.\n    &gt; 3. Third room: 3² - 2³ = 2³ - 3².\n    &gt;    *   The equation is not true. It cannot be correct.\n    &gt; Conclusion: The second room's sign is true, so the lion is in the third room.\n*   **Answer options (Conceptual):** in the first room, in the second room, the lion can be in any room, the lion can be in either the first or the second room. (*Note: If participant chose 'No', one of these options corresponding to the third room would be presented alongside three others.*)\n*   **Correct answer:** in the third room.\n\n### Correct 2\n\n*   **Puzzle Text:** Mikk is buying a sports club membership for the next month, allowing him to train on two days per week. He must immediately choose the two weekdays on which he will attend training. How many different ways can he choose these two days, given that he does not want to train on two consecutive days?\n*   **ChatGPT recommendation:**\n    &gt; First, we calculate all possible combinations of two days in a week:\n    &gt; (⁷₂) = 21\n    &gt; The pairs of consecutive days are:\n    &gt; (Monday, Tuesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday), (Wednesday, Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday), (Saturday, Sunday), (Sunday, Monday) — a total of 7 pairs.\n    &gt; We subtract the consecutive pairs from all combinations:\n    &gt; 21 - 7 = 14\n    &gt; Thus, the number of possible choices is:\n    &gt; 14\n*   **Answer options (Conceptual):** 16, 12, 10, 8 (*Note: If participant chose 'No', 14 would be removed, and they would choose from these four.*)\n*   **Correct answer:** 14\n\n### Correct 3\n\n*   **Puzzle Text:** Among the boys in the class, no two were born on the same day of the week, and among the girls in the class, no two were born in the same calendar month. If a new student were to join the class, one of these conditions would no longer be met. How many students are currently in the class?\n*   **ChatGPT recommendation:**\n    &gt; Let there be b boys and g girls in the class. The following two conditions are given:\n    &gt; 1. No boys in the class were born on the same day of the week.\n    &gt; 2. No girls in the class were born in the same calendar month.\n    &gt; Since no boys can be born on the same day of the week, the maximum number of boys is 7 (as there are 7 days in a week). Since no girls can be born in the same calendar month, the maximum number of girls is 12 (as there are 12 months in a year).\n    &gt; If a new student were to join the class, one of these conditions would no longer be met. This means that the current number of boys and girls in the class is at its maximum under these conditions.\n    &gt; The maximum number of boys is 7 (since more boys would mean that at least two were born on the same day of the week), and the maximum number of girls is 12 (since more girls would mean that at least two were born in the same calendar month).\n    &gt; Thus, there are currently 19 students in the class.\n*   **Answer options (Conceptual):** 18, 20, 24, 25 (*Note: If participant chose 'No', 19 would be removed.*)\n*   **Correct answer:** 19\n\n### Correct 4\n\n*   **Puzzle Text:** The teacher asked five of their students how many of them had studied at home the previous day. Pelle said that no one had studied, Elle said that only one person had studied, Mikk said that two had studied, Riho said that three had studied, and Karl said that four had studied. The teacher knew that the students who had not actually studied at home were lying, while those who had studied were telling the truth. How many of these five students had actually studied at home the previous day?\n*   **ChatGPT recommendation:**\n    &gt; Let x be the number of students who studied at home. Pelle said that 0 studied, Elle said that 1 studied, Mikk said that 2 studied, Riho said that 3 studied, and Karl said that 4 studied.\n    &gt; If x = 0, Pelle is telling the truth (1 truth, 4 lying). This doesn't work because everyone else would have to be lying.\n    &gt; If x = 1, Elle is telling the truth (1 truth, 4 lying), which works because one is telling the truth and the rest are lying.\n    &gt; If x = 2, Mikk is telling the truth (2 truth, 3 lying), but this doesn't work since there should be 2 truthful and 3 lying.\n    &gt; If x = 3, Riho is telling the truth (3 truth, 2 lying), which doesn't work as there should be 3 truthful and 2 lying.\n    &gt; If x = 4, Karl is telling the truth (4 truth, 1 lying), which also doesn't work as there should be 4 truthful and 1 lying.\n    &gt; The only possible solution is x = 1, meaning that 1 student studied at home the previous day.\n*   **Answer options (Conceptual):** 0, 2, 3, 4 (*Note: If participant chose 'No', 1 would be removed.*)\n*   **Correct answer:** 1\n\n### Incorrect 1\n\n*   **Puzzle Text:** Anni, Pille, Kati, Tiina, and Eerika attended a meeting. Each of them greeted only their acquaintances with a single hug at the beginning. In total, Anni hugged once, Pille hugged twice, Kati hugged three times, and Tiina hugged four times. How many times did Eerika hug? (Note: Each hug is mutual).\n*   **ChatGPT recommendation:**\n    &gt; Let A, P, K, T, and E represent Anni, Pille, Kati, Tiina, and Eerika, respectively. Each person hugs only their acquaintances, meaning every hug is mutual.\n    &gt; We know that the number of hugs each person gave is as follows: A = 1, P = 2, K = 3, T = 4.\n    &gt; Now, we calculate the total number of hugs. If x is the number of hugs Eerika gave, then:\n    &gt; 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + x = 2 × total mutual hugs\n    &gt; Total number of hugs:\n    &gt; 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + x = 10 + x\n    &gt; Since every hug is mutual, we divide the total number of hugs by two:\n    &gt; (10 + x) / 2\n    &gt; Since each person could only hug their acquaintances, x must be between 0 and 4. The only valid solution is x = 0.\n    &gt; Thus, Eerika hugged 0 times.\n*   **Answer options (Conceptual):** 5, 4, 3, 2 (*Note: If participant chose 'No', 0 would be removed.*)\n*   **Correct answer:** 2 times\n*   **ChatGPT's error:** The task states that there are five people (Anni, Pille, Kati, Tiina, Eerika). Tiina hugged four times. Since hugs are mutual and Tiina only hugs acquaintances, she must know all four other people. Eerika must therefore be one of the people Tiina hugged. Eerika must have hugged at least once (Tiina). ChatGPT claims 0, incorrectly deducing x must be between 0 and 4, and incorrectly solving the handshake problem logic (the sum of degrees must be even, 1+2+3+4+x = 10+x must be even, so x can be 0, 2, or 4. With T=4 hugging everyone else, E must hug T, so x&gt;=1. Thus x=2 or x=4. A graph drawing confirms x=2).\n\n### Incorrect 2\n\n*   **Puzzle Text:** Emma, Ivi, Rita, and Siiri have ages of 3, 8, 12, and 14 years in some order. Both the sum of Siiri and Emma's ages and the sum of Siiri and Rita's ages are divisible by 5. Find the sum of Siiri and Ivi's ages.\n*   **ChatGPT recommendation:**\n    &gt; The given ages of Emma, Ivi, Rita, and Siiri are 3, 8, 12, and 14 years. We have two conditions:\n    &gt; 1. The sum of Siiri and Emma's ages is divisible by 5.\n    &gt; 2. The sum of Siiri and Rita's ages is divisible by 5.\n    &gt; Let's check all possible ages for Siiri:\n    &gt; 1. Siiri = 3: 3 + X and 3 + Y do not give results divisible by 5.\n    &gt; 2. Siiri = 8: 8 + X and 8 + Y do not give results divisible by 5.\n    &gt; 3. Siiri = 12: 12 + X and 12 + Y do not give results divisible by 5.\n    &gt; 4. Siiri = 14:\n    &gt;    *   14 + X and 14 + Y are divisible by 5 only if X = 12 and Y = 6.\n    &gt;    *   Thus, Emma = 12 and Rita = 8.\n    &gt; Siiri and Ivi's ages are 14 and 3. Their sum is 17.\n    &gt; Answer: 17.\n*   **Answer options (Conceptual):** 26, 22, 20, 15 (*Note: If participant chose 'No', 17 would be removed.*)\n*   **Correct answer:** 26\n*   **ChatGPT's error:** ChatGPT incorrectly dismisses Siiri = 3, 8, 12. Let's test Siiri=12. Possible pairs summing to a multiple of 5 with 12 are (12+3=15) and (12+8=20). So, if Siiri=12, Emma=3, Rita=8 (or vice versa). Then Ivi must be 14. The sum of Siiri (12) and Ivi (14) is 26. ChatGPT's check for Siiri=14 is flawed: it requires Y=6, which is not one of the available ages (3, 8, 12, 14). It then claims Rita=8 without justification for the change from 6.\n\n### Incorrect 3\n\n*   **Puzzle Text:** Tiit is convinced that his clock is 5 minutes fast, but in reality, his clock is 10 minutes slow. Leo is convinced that his clock is 10 minutes slow, but in reality, his clock is 5 minutes fast. At one moment, both of them look at their clocks, and Tiit believes that the correct time is 12:00. What does Leo think the correct time is at that moment?\n*   **ChatGPT recommendation:**\n    &gt; Tiit believes that his clock is 5 minutes fast, but in reality, his clock is 10 minutes slow. So, if Tiit thinks the correct time is 12:00, then according to his clock, the time is:\n    &gt; 12:00 - 5 minutes = 11:55\n    &gt; Since his clock is actually 10 minutes slow, the real time is:\n    &gt; 11:55 + 10 minutes = 12:05\n    &gt; Now let's check Leo's clock. Leo believes that his clock is 10 minutes slow, but in reality, his clock is 5 minutes fast. When Leo looks at his clock, the time he sees is:\n    &gt; Actual time - 10 minutes = 12:05 - 10 minutes = 11:55\n    &gt; Since Leo's clock is actually 5 minutes fast, the time on his clock is:\n    &gt; 11:55 - 5 minutes = 11:50\n    &gt; Thus, if Tiit thinks the correct time is 12:00, then Leo believes the correct time at that moment is 11:50.\n*   **Answer options (Conceptual):** 11:30, 11:45, 12:00, 12:30 (*Note: If participant chose 'No', 11:50 would be removed.*)\n*   **Correct answer:** 12:30\n*   **ChatGPT's error:** Initial step is wrong. If Tiit *believes* the correct time is 12:00 and *believes* his clock is 5 minutes fast, his clock must *show* 12:05 (because he would subtract 5 mins from his clock reading to get his believed time). Since his clock is *actually* 10 minutes slow, the *real* time is 12:05 + 10 minutes = 12:15. Leo's clock is *actually* 5 minutes fast, so it *shows* 12:15 + 5 minutes = 12:20. Leo *believes* his clock is 10 minutes slow, so he *believes* the correct time is 12:20 + 10 minutes = 12:30.\n\n### Incorrect 4\n\n*   **Puzzle Text:** An old-fashioned scale is not working correctly. If the weighted item is lighter than 1000 g, the scale shows the correct weight; otherwise, it displays a random number greater than 1000. Five objects, A, B, C, D, and E, were all lighter than 1000 g. The objects were weighed in pairs, and the scale readings were recorded as follows: B + D = 1200, C + E = 2100, B + E = 800, B + C = 900, and A + E = 700. Which of these objects was the heaviest?\n*   **ChatGPT recommendation:**\n    &gt; We have five objects: A, B, C, D, and E, all weighing less than 1000 g. When weighed in pairs, the recorded results were:\n    &gt; B + D = 1200, C + E = 2100, B + E = 800, B + C = 900, A + E = 700.\n    &gt; The valid equations are: B + E = 800, B + C = 900, A + E = 700. Since B + E = 800 and B + C = 900, it follows that C = 100.\n    &gt; Substituting into A + E = 700: A + (800 - B) = 700, we get A = -100 + B.\n    &gt; Finally, we solve: (900 - B) + (800 - B) = 2100, which results in B = -200.\n    &gt; Thus, E is the heaviest object.\n*   **Answer options (Conceptual):** A, B, C, D (*Note: If participant chose 'No', E would be removed.*)\n*   **Correct answer:** D\n*   **ChatGPT's error:** ChatGPT correctly identifies the valid equations (where sum &lt; 1000 is implied, but the scale shows correct weight regardless since individual items &lt; 1000g means pairs could be &lt; 1000g or &gt; 1000g. It only shows *correct* weight if item &lt; 1000g. This rule seems misstated or misinterpreted. Let's assume the equations B+E=800, B+C=900, A+E=700 are correct weights because sum &lt; 1000). From B+E=800 and B+C=900, we can infer C = E + 100. From A+E=700, A = 700-E. From B+E=800, B=800-E. Since B+C=900, (800-E) + (E+100) = 900, which is 900=900, consistent. Now consider B+D=1200 and C+E=2100. These sums are &gt;1000, so the scale reading is random and &gt;1000. These equations give no info. We have weights in terms of E: A=700-E, B=800-E, C=100+E, D=?, E=E. All weights must be positive. So 700-E&gt;0 (E&lt;700) and 800-E&gt;0 (E&lt;800). Also E&gt;0. So 0 &lt; E &lt; 700. We need to find the heaviest. Can we deduce D? No information. ChatGPT's calculation leading to C=100 is wrong (it should be C=E+100). Its calculation A=-100+B is wrong (should be A=700-E). Its final solve step `(900 - B) + (800 - B) = 2100` is mixing valid equations (B+C=900 implies C=900-B) with an invalid one (C+E=2100, which should be ignored). Its result B=-200 is impossible. It incorrectly concludes E is heaviest. The actual solution requires careful deduction: B+E=800, B+C=900 -&gt; C &gt; E. A+E=700, B+E=800 -&gt; B &gt; A. B+C=900. Max possible sum of two items &lt; 1000g is slightly less than 2000g. B+D=1200, C+E=2100. Since C+E &gt; 2000 (impossible if both &lt;1000), the 2100 reading is random. B+D=1200 must be the actual sum B+D=1200. Since B&lt;1000, D must be &gt;200. We have B=800-E, C=E+100, A=700-E. Weights are (700-E, 800-E, E+100, D, E). Since B+D=1200, D=1200-B = 1200-(800-E) = 400+E. The weights are (700-E, 800-E, 100+E, 400+E, E). Comparing these: D &gt; B &gt; A. D &gt; C if 400+E &gt; 100+E (true). D &gt; E if 400+E &gt; E (true). So D is the heaviest.\n``````````````````` :::"

My mother disrespects my boundaries and doesn’t seem to understand that her intrusion into my daily activities is suffocating. My brother will drop his kids off for 12 hour days, and while I love my nieces and nephews, I’m starting to feel like my life is not really my own.”\n\n\n\nPositive Prompt Example\n\n“Today was my final day of therapy! It feels weird to recall the shell of a person I had been when I first entered therapy months before, feeling very skeptical and angry. Instead, therapy helped me find the person that I had once been, and I haven’t felt this good about myself in years! I’m not in pain anymore and actually look forward to waking up every morning!”"

Perceived Responsiveness (Study 4 Only)\nIn Study 4, participants evaluated the responsiveness of each transparently labeled human and AI response using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree), based on facets adapted from Maisel et al. (2008):\n\nUnderstanding: (Measured with three items, e.g., paraphrasing, inquiring further, expressing understanding).\nValidation: (Measured with three items, e.g., agreeing, validating feelings/emotions, using exclamations/judgments).\nCaring: (Measured with three items, e.g., expressing empathy/emotions, offering support/concern/comfort, emphasizing outcomes).\n\n(Note: The specific items for each facet are not listed in the main paper text but are referenced)."

    "text": "Code\n\n\n\n\nAs a cognitive science expert tasked with rigorously evaluating research proposals, I approach this analysis by first establishing a clear understanding of the problem domain and the theoretical underpinnings relevant to the proposed study. The query outlines a research proposal focusing on the intersection of human cognition and artificial intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), within the context of energy literacy, appliance knowledge, AI literacy, human-AI reliance, uncertainty perception, and trust in AI. This area is particularly pertinent given the increasing integration of AI into systems that influence human decision-making, demanding a nuanced understanding of cognitive processes, human-AI interaction dynamics, and robust evaluation methodologies.\nAnalysis of the Problem’s Nature, Scope, and Core Requirements\nThe core problem lies in understanding how humans interact with, perceive, and utilize AI, particularly LLMs, in domains requiring specific knowledge and decision-making. This involves several intertwined cognitive and social constructs:\n\nDomain Knowledge (e.g., Energy Literacy, Appliance Knowledge): This refers to an individual’s understanding of concepts, facts, and processes within a specific area, such as energy consumption or appliance operation. While the provided sources do not directly address energy or appliance knowledge, they discuss the importance of domain-specific evaluation of LLMs and the broader concept of human knowledge influencing interaction. Critically, the proposal posits investigating this domain, which necessitates measures for assessing human knowledge in these areas and evaluating LLMs’ capabilities within them.\nAI Literacy: This construct encompasses an individual’s understanding of AI, including its capabilities, limitations, ethical implications, and how to effectively use it. Assessing AI literacy is crucial for understanding how users approach AI interaction and evaluate its outputs. Valid and reliable instruments are required to measure different facets of AI literacy, such as ‘Recognize’, ‘Use & Apply’, ‘Evaluate’, and ‘Ethics’.\nTrust in AI (TiA): TiA is a multifaceted construct influenced by factors like the AI’s perceived trustworthiness, reliability, capability, and user’s dispositional trust. Evaluating TiA is essential as it significantly impacts reliance. Measurement requires capturing specific components of trust, moving beyond monolithic views. Challenges include encompassing all factors and the dynamic nature of trust.\nHuman-AI Reliance and Uncertainty Perception: Reliance refers to the degree to which humans follow AI advice. Appropriate reliance involves leveraging AI when correct but overriding it when incorrect, influenced by trust and uncertainty perception. Understanding how humans perceive and respond to AI-expressed uncertainty is critical for calibration. Reliance can be affected by AI characteristics (e.g., explanation style, anthropomorphism, confidence signaling) and human factors (e.g., cognitive biases, metacognition).\nMental Models of LLMs: This refers to a human user’s internal representation and understanding of how the LLM works, its capabilities, limitations, and decision-making process. Accurate mental models are vital for effective human-AI collaboration and appropriate reliance. Measuring these mental models is challenging, often relying on methods like open-ended questions and coding.\n\nThe scope of the problem requires integrating insights from cognitive psychology, human-computer interaction, AI evaluation, and potentially domain-specific fields (like energy studies, not explicitly in sources). Core requirements for a rigorous study include: * Developing clear operational definitions for each construct. * Selecting or developing validated and reliable measurement tools for human knowledge (domain, AI literacy), trust, reliance, uncertainty perception, and mental models. * Establishing metrics for evaluating LLM performance within the chosen domain tasks. * Designing experiments or surveys that allow for assessing the relationships between these constructs and human-AI interaction outcomes (e.g., decision accuracy, efficiency). * Considering potential confounding factors, such as individual differences (e.g., cognitive abilities, attitudes towards AI).\nGrounded in real-world constraints, this research acknowledges that AI systems, including LLMs, are often “black boxes”, their performance can be non-deterministic and continuously evolving, and human cognitive resources (e.g., time, attention) are limited. Therefore, evaluations must account for opacity, dynamic nature, and cognitive load.\nConceptual Framework\nDrawing upon the sources, a potential conceptual framework to guide this research could be an adaptation of the AI-person-environment fit framework, integrated with cognitive models and theories of trust and reliance.\n+-------------------+     +------------------------+     +-------------------+\n| Environment (Task)| --&gt; | AI (LLM) Characteristics| --&gt; | Human Decision-   |\n| (e.g., Energy Qs, |     | (Capabilities, Explan. |     |  Maker            |\n|  Appliance Issues)|     |  Style, Confidence, etc)|     | (Domain Knowledge,|\n+-------------------+     +------------------------+     |  AI Literacy,     |\n        ^                               ^              |  Dispositional    |\n        |                               |              |  Trust, Metacogn.)|\n        |                               |              +-------------------+\n        |                               |                       |\n        |                               |                       | Perception & Cognitive Processes\n        |                               |                       v\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|  Mediating/Moderating Factors:                                     |\n|  - Human's Mental Model of AI                           |\n|  - Perceived Trustworthiness of AI                         |\n|  - Perceived Uncertainty in AI Output                          |\n|  - Cognitive Load during Interaction                           |\n|  - Human Metacognition (monitoring AI & self)                  |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n        ^                               v\n        |                               |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|  Outcomes:                                                          |\n|  - Human-AI Reliance (Appropriate vs. Inappropriate)   |\n|  - Decision Performance (Accuracy, Efficiency)       |\n|  - User Satisfaction/Experience                                     |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\nThis framework suggests that AI characteristics and the task environment influence human cognitive processes and perceptions (mental models, trust, uncertainty, load, metacognition), which in turn mediate or moderate the relationship between the AI/Task and the interaction outcomes. Relevant cognitive psychology frameworks include theories of decision-making under uncertainty, resource-rationality (trading off accuracy/time), and critical thinking (evaluating information). Philosophical underpinnings touch upon the nature of knowledge representation in humans and machines, the distinction between normative rationality and psychological processes, and the ethical implications of AI influence.\nEvaluation of the Current Survey Draft for Proposal\nGiven that the “Current Survey Draft for Proposal” is not provided, this evaluation will address common potential deficiencies and requirements based on the outlined problem and relevant literature from the sources. A meticulously critical agent would scrutinize the proposal along the following lines:\n\nThoroughness of Measurement:\n\nDeficiency: Does the survey thoroughly measure all specified constructs (domain knowledge, AI literacy, trust, reliance, uncertainty perception, mental models)? Many existing measures, particularly for trust, may capture only specific components (e.g., capability, benevolence) rather than a holistic view. Reliance needs to assess not just agreement but appropriate reliance (agreement when AI is correct, disagreement when incorrect).\nRequirement: The proposal must detail how each construct is operationalized and measured, justifying the selection or development of instruments. It should articulate which facets of multi-dimensional constructs (like trust or AI literacy) are being assessed. Measurement of mental models of LLMs, a key focus, requires methods beyond simple quantitative scales, such as open-ended questions analyzed with techniques like coding and inter-rater reliability (e.g., Cohen’s Kappa).\n\nAccuracy and Relevance of Measurement:\n\nDeficiency: Are the selected measures valid and reliable for the target population and context? Validity (construct, external, ecological) and reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, inter-rater) are paramount. For example, a measure of AI literacy might have satisfactory convergent validity overall but unreliable distinct sub-constructs. Relying on single-item measures can raise concerns about reliability. Measurement validation is a non-trivial consideration, especially for complex constructs or when adapting measures to new contexts (e.g., traditional psychological tests for LLMs). Applying measures designed for human-human trust or traditional automation to LLMs requires careful consideration and validation.\nRequirement: The proposal must provide evidence (from literature or pilot testing) for the reliability and validity of all measures. If existing measures are adapted or new ones developed, the proposal must outline a clear plan for validation. This includes specifying types of validity/reliability assessed (e.g., construct validity via CFA, inter-rater reliability via Cohen’s Kappa) and reporting relevant metrics (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha, RMSEA, CFI) with established thresholds. Domain-specific questions (e.g., energy/appliance) must accurately reflect relevant knowledge.\n\nNovelty and Justification of Research Questions/Hypotheses:\n\nDeficiency: Does the proposal clearly articulate how its research questions and hypotheses extend existing knowledge? Studies on trust, reliance, and AI literacy exist. The novelty must come from the specific combination of constructs, the application domain (energy/appliances - not in sources, must be justified), the focus on LLMs, or the methods for assessing mental models. Without proper justification against the current literature, the research could be seen as merely replicating known findings. Hypotheses must be precisely formulated and directly derivable from theory or prior empirical findings.\nRequirement: The proposal must include a thorough literature review that clearly identifies gaps in research concerning the specific interplay between domain knowledge (e.g., energy, noting this is outside the provided sources’ scope), AI literacy, trust, reliance, and mental models in the context of LLMs. The research questions must logically flow from these gaps, and hypotheses must be explicitly linked to theoretical frameworks (e.g., AI-person-environment fit, trust calibration, resource-rationality) or empirical evidence.\n\nLogical Structure and Justification of Design:\n\nDeficiency: Is the overall study design (e.g., survey, experiment) logically structured to test the hypotheses? Does it account for potential confounds? For example, simply correlating survey measures might not establish causal relationships. An experimental design would be stronger for investigating causal influences (e.g., manipulating AI explanation style or confidence signaling). The choice of LLM model and prompting strategy must be justified, acknowledging the non-deterministic and evolving nature of LLMs and their sensitivity to prompts.\nRequirement: The proposal needs a clear methodology section detailing the study design, participant recruitment (justifying sample size and characteristics for generalizability), procedure, and data analysis plan. It must explain how the design allows for answering the research questions and testing hypotheses. For experimental elements, variables (independent, dependent, mediating, moderating) should be clearly defined. The selection of the LLM(s) and interaction paradigm (e.g., AI as tool, collaborator, teammate) should be justified. Strategies for handling LLM variability (e.g., using consistent API versions, presenting multiple trials) should be discussed. The proposal must also consider potential biases (e.g., social desirability bias in surveys, anchoring bias to AI) and outline mitigation strategies.\n\nFocus on Measuring Mental Models of LLMs:\n\nDeficiency: Is the approach to measuring human mental models of LLMs sufficiently robust and aligned with established (or emerging) methods? Simply asking participants if they “understand” the AI is insufficient. Measures need to probe the content and structure of the mental model. Over-reliance on single quantitative items or scales may lack the necessary granularity.\nRequirement: As highlighted in the sources, measuring mental models of AI can involve using open-ended questions asking humans to explain the AI’s underlying model or reasoning process. The proposal must detail the prompts used, the coding scheme for analyzing responses, and the method for establishing inter-rater reliability (e.g., Cohen’s Kappa) for the coding process. The goal is to identify categories of errors or inaccuracies in human understanding, which can inform how to improve AI explanations or interaction design. The proposal should justify why this qualitative or mixed-methods approach is necessary and how the findings will contribute to understanding reliance and collaboration.\n\n\nIn summary, a critical evaluation of the “Current Survey Draft for Proposal” would focus on the precision, validation, and justification of its measurement tools and design against the complex, multi-faceted nature of human-AI interaction, drawing heavily on the principles of psychometrics and experimental design discussed in the sources.\nScenario-Based LLM Beliefs Questions\nTo measure a human user’s mental model of an LLM (i.e., what the user thinks the LLM knows or believes), scenario-based questions can be particularly effective. These scenarios should probe the user’s understanding of the LLM’s knowledge limits, reasoning capabilities, and potential biases. Here are some examples, incorporating the (hypothetical) energy/appliance domain:\n\nScenario (Knowledge Limit): “Imagine you asked an LLM about the energy consumption of a very obscure vintage appliance from the 1950s that wasn’t widely documented online. What kind of answer do you think the LLM would most likely give?\n\n\nA precise number for energy consumption.\n\n\nA general estimate based on similar modern appliances.\n\n\nState that it doesn’t have information on that specific appliance.\n\n\nFabricate a plausible-sounding but incorrect number.”\n\n(Follow-up, open-ended): Why do you think the LLM would give that answer? What does this tell you about the LLM’s knowledge? (Probes understanding of training data limits and potential for hallucination).\n\nScenario (Reasoning/Updating Beliefs): “Suppose you told the LLM that you read in a recent scientific paper (published last month) that a popular smart home device actually consumes significantly more energy than previously thought due to a software bug. If you then ask the LLM about that device’s energy use, what would it most likely say?\n\n\nProvide the old, widely known energy consumption figure.\n\n\nProvide the new figure from the recent paper.\n\n\nMention both figures and perhaps express uncertainty.\n\n\nAsk for more information about the paper.”\n\n(Follow-up, open-ended): Why would the LLM respond that way? Does the LLM seem to ‘learn’ or update its information from your input? (Probes understanding of LLM’s static knowledge base vs. dynamic learning, sensitivity to input).\n\nScenario (Bias Awareness): “You ask the LLM for advice on choosing the most energy-efficient appliance from a list that includes both standard models and more expensive ‘eco-friendly’ models from companies that heavily advertise online (which the LLM was likely trained on). If the ‘eco-friendly’ models are not actually significantly more efficient, how do you think the LLM would describe them?\n\n\nObjectively state the energy consumption figures for all models.\n\n\nStrongly recommend the ‘eco-friendly’ models, highlighting their purported benefits.\n\n\nExpress uncertainty or caution about the ‘eco-friendly’ claims.\n\n\nProvide a generic comparison without specific recommendations.”\n\n(Follow-up, open-ended): What factors do you think might influence the LLM’s description or recommendation in this case? (Probes understanding of potential training data biases and their influence on output).\n\nScenario (Explaining Process): “The LLM just recommended a specific sequence of steps to troubleshoot an appliance issue, and the steps seemed somewhat counter-intuitive but ended up working. In your own words, how would you describe why you think the LLM suggested that specific sequence of steps?”\n\n(Open-ended): Please explain your reasoning. (Directly probes the user’s attempt to construct a mental model of the LLM’s problem-solving or reasoning process).\n\n\nThese questions are designed to elicit responses that reveal the user’s implicit assumptions about the LLM’s capabilities and limitations, providing data points for qualitative coding and assessment of mental model accuracy.\nNovel Survey Ideas Combining Measurement Approaches\nThe query requests brainstorming survey ideas that combine elements of human estimation (like Attari studies, though these are not in the sources provided), rating LLM accuracy, and potentially other measures from the sources. Since I cannot directly reference researchers outside the provided sources, I will focus on combining the types of measurements and constructs discussed in the sources (human estimation/performance, AI evaluation/accuracy, AI literacy, trust, reliance, uncertainty perception, mental models) within the context of a knowledge-based domain (using the hypothetical energy/appliance domain while noting it is outside the sources).\nHere are several brainstormed ideas for novel survey/experimental designs:\n\nComparative Estimation & Reliance Calibration Study:\n\nSetup: Present participants with a series of knowledge questions about energy consumption or appliance characteristics (e.g., “Estimate the average annual energy consumption of a standard refrigerator,” “What is the most energy-intensive typical household appliance?”). This assesses their domain knowledge and estimation ability before interacting with the AI.\nAI Interaction: For each question, after the human provides their estimate/answer, provide an answer generated by an LLM. Crucially, vary the LLM’s presented confidence level (e.g., explicit statement of confidence, or implicit through answer phrasing). The LLM’s answers would be pre-generated and controlled for accuracy on a subset of questions (some correct, some incorrect) and associated with varied presented confidence levels, which may or may not align with actual accuracy (probing calibration).\nMeasurement:\n\nHuman Initial Estimate/Answer (Baseline Domain Knowledge).\nHuman Rating of LLM Confidence for each answer.\nHuman Rating of LLM Accuracy for each answer.\nHuman Final Answer/Decision (allowing measurement of reliance – agreement/disagreement with LLM).\nPost-task survey measures: AI Literacy (e.g., MAILS or similar constructs), Trust in AI (specific components like competence, reliability), Dispositional Trust.\nOpen-ended questions probing why the human agreed/disagreed with the AI, especially in cases of high-confidence errors or low-confidence correct answers, to assess elements of their mental model and reasoning process.\n\nAnalysis: Analyze human vs. LLM accuracy, human-AI agreement rates (overall reliance), appropriate reliance rates (agreement on correct, disagreement on incorrect), and how these relate to human initial knowledge, AI literacy, trust measures, perceived AI confidence/accuracy, and qualitative insights from mental model questions. Examine calibration gaps between perceived AI confidence and actual accuracy. This design allows for investigating anchoring bias to AI advice.\n\nMental Model Elicitation Through Prediction & Explanation:\n\nSetup: Introduce participants to an LLM designed for a specific task (e.g., recommending energy-saving behaviors). Describe some of its general capabilities but keep its internal workings opaque. Present a series of scenarios involving user queries and potential LLM responses (including correct, incorrect, or subtly biased ones).\nMeasurement:\n\nFor each scenario, ask participants to predict what the LLM would say or do.\nAsk participants to explain why they think the LLM would respond that way, probing their understanding of its underlying mechanisms, data sources, or programming.\nPresent the actual pre-generated LLM response. Ask participants if the response matched their expectation and to explain any discrepancies.\nInclude targeted questions about LLM limitations (e.g., “Can the LLM access real-time energy price data?”, “Can the LLM understand your personal energy habits?”).\nAdminister AI Literacy questionnaire and a measure of confidence in one’s own understanding of AI.\n\nAnalysis: Analyze the accuracy of human predictions about LLM behavior. Code the human explanations for themes related to mental model components (e.g., understands training data, recognizes limitations, attributes reasoning style) using inter-rater reliability. Correlate mental model accuracy/sophistication with AI literacy scores and self-reported confidence. This design focuses directly on eliciting and evaluating the structure and content of the human mental model.\n\nImpact of Explanation Style on Mental Models and Reliance:\n\nSetup: Replicate a task requiring LLM assistance (e.g., diagnosing appliance issues based on symptoms). Vary the style of the LLM’s explanation for its diagnosis (e.g., brief answer vs. detailed, step-by-step reasoning vs. citing hypothetical examples). Use multiple trials with some scenarios where the AI is intentionally incorrect.\nMeasurement:\n\nDecision Outcome (correct diagnosis or troubleshooting step taken).\nReliance (agreement with AI diagnosis/steps).\nAppropriate Reliance (agreement on correct, disagreement on incorrect).\nAfter each trial or set of trials, use targeted open-ended questions to assess the human’s understanding of how the AI arrived at its conclusion, tailored to the explanation style received.\nMeasures of cognitive load during the task.\nPost-task measures of perceived trustworthiness and AI literacy.\n\nAnalysis: Compare appropriate reliance and decision performance across explanation style conditions. Analyze the coded open-ended responses to see if different explanation styles lead to more accurate or complete mental models of the AI’s reasoning process. Investigate whether mental model quality mediates the relationship between explanation style and appropriate reliance. Assess the relationship between cognitive load and mental model formation or reliance.\n\n\nThese ideas leverage different measurement techniques mentioned in the sources—quantitative scales, behavioral outcomes (decisions, reliance), and qualitative data (open-ended responses coded for mental models)—to explore the complex relationships between human factors and AI interaction. They emphasize the importance of assessing human understanding of the AI as a key variable, as suggested by sources focusing on mental models and metacognition.\nAnnotated Bibliography of Relevant Validated Surveys/Measures\nIdentifying precisely 15 distinct, fully described and validated surveys within the provided excerpts is challenging, as the sources often refer to types of measures, specific scales in passing, or discuss validation criteria rather than presenting instruments. However, based on the mentions and discussions of validity/reliability:\n\nMAILS (Meta AI Literacy Scale): A subjective assessment scale with 34 items covering core AI literacy constructs, AI self-efficacy, and AI self-management. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results discussed, noting ‘Create’ as a separate factor and ‘Evaluate’ relating to ‘Know & Understand’. Validity requires refinement and validation across diverse contexts.\n\nRelevance: Directly measures AI literacy, a core construct. Discussion of CFA indicates attention to construct validity.\n\nLaupichler et al. Assessment Tool: A general AI literacy instrument for non-experts (38 items), formulated using the Delphi method based on accepted definitions. Covers core AI literacy constructs. Authors suggest item reduction and further validation.\n\nRelevance: Measures AI literacy. Mention of Delphi method implies content validation. Need for further validation noted.\n\nWang et al. AI Literacy Scale: Psychometric scale (12 items) covering ‘Recognize’, ‘Use and Apply’, ‘Evaluate’, and ‘Ethics’. Reported satisfactory convergent validity, but distinct constructs alone may not yield reliable results.\n\nRelevance: Measures AI literacy. Explicit mention of psychometric rigor and convergent validity.\n\nMayer’s Process-Oriented Trust Model Components: Discussed not as a survey itself, but as a framework components (Factors of Perceived Trustworthiness, Risk-Taking in Relationship) that measures should map onto. Emphasizes need to capture specific components beyond monolithic ‘trust’.\n\nRelevance: Provides theoretical basis for measuring trust components. Essential for construct validity of trust measures.\n\nJian’s Checklist for Trust (2000): Mentioned as a measure whose outcomes (e.g., on trust components) might differ from reliance outcomes because they capture different elements of the trust process. Implies it measures specific facets of trust or trustworthiness.\n\nRelevance: Example of a measure attempting to capture aspects of trust, highlighting the challenge of distinct trust components vs. reliance.\n\nMeasures Discussed in Razin & Feigh Meta-Analysis: The meta-analysis reviews Human-Machine Trust Questionnaires, discussing validation criteria (Statistical Conclusion, Instrument, Content, Construct Validity). Recommends multi-factorial instruments tested for reliability (Cronbach’s alpha, McDonald’s l, inter-item correlation) and validity (loadings, communalities, CFA metrics: chi-squared, RMSEA, SRMR, CFI, TLI). While specific survey names aren’t always the focus, the criteria for evaluating them are detailed.\n\nRelevance: Provides a comprehensive framework and specific statistical metrics for evaluating the reliability and validity of trust questionnaires, crucial for assessing measures used in the proposal.\n\nScholz et al. Propensity to Trust in Automated Technology (PTT-A) Scale: Discussed as a measure of dispositional trust in automation, developed via item pre-selection based on expert ratings and testing competing models. Acknowledges need for further validation.\n\nRelevance: Provides a measure for dispositional trust in AI, a potential antecedent to situational trust and reliance. Mention of expert rating and model testing implies validation steps.\n\nCohen’s Kappa: A statistical metric used to measure inter-rater reliability. Recommended for use when coding qualitative data, such as responses to open-ended questions about a user’s understanding of an AI agent’s model.\n\nRelevance: Not a survey, but a validated method essential for ensuring reliability when coding data used to assess human mental models of AI from open-ended responses.\n\nQuestionnaires/Protocols in AI Trust Evaluation: Sources mention the use of questionnaires, experimental protocols, and qualitative evaluations to assess trust between humans and AI. Challenges include encompassing all trust factors and the dynamic nature of trust.\n\nRelevance: Indicates typical methods used for trust evaluation, reinforcing the points about multi-dimensionality and validation challenges.\n\nOpen-ended Questions for Mental Models: A method described for assessing human understanding of an AI agent’s underlying model. Involves asking users to explain the AI and then coding responses.\n\nRelevance: A key technique specifically mentioned for assessing mental models of AI, a focus area of the query. Reliability relies on coding and inter-rater agreement (Cohen’s Kappa).\n\nPsychometric Tests (General): Referenced in the context of measuring cognitive constraints or capacities and psychological attributes of LLMs (internal consistency, parallel forms reliability). Includes examples like Big Five Inventory or cultural orientation survey (used for LLMs). Item Response Theory (IRT) and Classical Test Theory (CTT) are discussed as frameworks for test development and evaluation.\n\nRelevance: Provides the psychometric foundation for developing or selecting any scales/questionnaires used in the study (e.g., AI literacy, domain knowledge, trust facets), emphasizing concepts like item difficulty and ability estimation.\n\nLSAT Questions: Used in a study to assess logical reasoning ability in humans interacting with AI. Validity for logical reasoning is assumed due to typical use, but limitations regarding diversity of real-world reasoning and overlap with AI training data are noted.\n\nRelevance: Example of using standardized tests adapted from other domains to assess human cognitive abilities relevant to AI interaction (e.g., reasoning, critical thinking). Need for careful consideration of limitations.\n\nDecision-Making Paradigms (e.g., Decisions from Description): Used to test cognitive biases and decision processes in humans and LLMs. Involves structured choices between options with defined outcomes/probabilities. Rigorous experimental control needed.\n\nRelevance: Represents a class of validated experimental tasks from cognitive psychology for assessing human decision-making, which can be used to measure reliance and performance in AI-assisted contexts.\n\nReal-world Exams (e.g., USMLE, AIIMS/NEET, OKAP, Surgical Board Exams): Used to evaluate LLMs’ domain-specific knowledge in fields like medicine. These are validated tests for human knowledge.\n\nRelevance: Suggests that validated tests from a domain (like hypothetically, energy efficiency certifications or quizzes) could be adapted to measure human and potentially AI domain knowledge in the proposal’s specified area.\n\nSelf-report Ratings (e.g., Likert scales): Widely used across many areas mentioned (trust, factual consistency of summaries, perceived confidence). While common, their validity depends heavily on careful wording and study design to mitigate biases (e.g., social desirability) and ensure they capture the intended construct component.\n\nRelevance: A fundamental method of data collection requiring careful validation. Discussed in sources regarding measuring trust components, AI literacy, and confidence/perception.\n\n\nThis list reflects the types of measures and validation considerations prominent in the provided sources. A strong research proposal would engage with these points, demonstrating a clear understanding of the measurement challenges and proposing robust solutions grounded in psychometric principles and validated methodologies."

The questions will be delivered and answered orally. The two mains tasks for this session are:\n\nA behavior choice task, where I will ask you to think through the relative energy costs or savings potential of various routine appliances and activities\nAn estimation task, wherein you will provide an estimate of the energy consumed by various household appliances\n\nAfter completing these tasks, I will ask that you share some reflections on the tasks and the ways that your experience and expertise informed your approaches. We will finish with a brief final set of questions about your background.\n\n\nOpen-ended questions\n\nHow much do you think about the amount of energy you use on a day-to-day basis?\nHow does thinking about energy use factor into your professional life?\nWhat actions have you taken in the past to reduce your personal energy consumption?\n\n\n\nTalk-aloud protocol warm-up¹\nWe are interested in what you say to yourself as you perform the next task. I will ask you to talk aloud as you work on the problems. What I mean by talk aloud is that I want you to say out loud everything that you that you say yourself silently. Just act as if you are alone in the room, speaking to yourself. If you are silent for any length of time, I will remind you to keep talking aloud.\nBefore we turn to the main task, we will start with a couple of practice problems. I want you to talk aloud while you do these problems.\n\nFirst, I want to ask you to add 82 and 18 in your head.\nNext, I would like you to tell me how many windows are in your house.\n\n\n\nChoice task\n[The instructions and each of the choice sets will be presented to the participant on a single sheet in landscape format if in person; if interview is remote, then each item will be presented on a separate screen on Qualtrics; correct values are provided in parentheses and were not included in the original document]\nIn the following sets, please choose the option that uses the least amount of energy.

    "text": "Supplementary Table 1: Choice task codebook\nTo extract the list of heuristics employed by experts during the choice task, the verbal reports made by the participants were transcribed and analyzed. The first layer of analysis entailed developing a coding scheme to categorize the content of the verbal reports. A codebook was developed to sort the information used by the experts into primary and secondary categories. Primary codes were developed for the three general content areas of the expert interviews: references to (1) observable cues about energy use, (2) device functions, and (3) device components. Each primary code was disaggregated into several secondary codes, each of which refers to a more detailed aspect of the primary code’s general theme. For example, the “Observable Cues” primary code family contained eight secondary codes, including “hot to touch,” “dims lights/trips circuits,” and “thick cord.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary code\nSecondary code\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nExternal cues\n\nDiscusses the easily observable features or effects on the environment of a device\n\n\n\nColor\nAssesses the color or color change of a device when in use\n\n\n\nDim lights/trip circuit\nAssesses whether room lighting dims or a circuit is tripped when a device is turned on or used\n\n\n\nHot to touch\nMentions that the appliance or the air immediately around it gets warms up/gets hot while the appliance is in operation, or that the appliance needs a period of cool down after use\n\n\n\nNoisy\nAssesses the amount of sound associated with the appliance while in use\n\n\n\nPlug size\nAssesses the size or type of plug that a device uses, including references to physical dimensions or voltage\n\n\n\nSize\nAssesses the size (volume) of a device or its components (“X is small”), excluding references to the volume of space that the device affects (e.g., “Ovens heat a small space” or “Space heaters heat a large room”); states or implies that energy use scales with the size of the device (e.g., bigger blenders use more energy than smaller ones)\n\n\n\nThick cord\nAssesses the size or type of the device’s power cord\n\n\n\nWeight\nAssesses the size (weight) of a device\n\n\nFunction\n\nReferences function, activity, or purpose of the device; these could be either primary functions (e.g., space heaters heat the air) or secondary functions (e.g., dishwashers heat water to clean dishes)\n\n\n\nComparisons\nMakes a direct comparison of the relative energy requirements of two different functions (e.g., heating versus cooling) or compares the energy use of different devices with the same function (e.g., blenders and fans both circulate through fluids)\n\n\n\nCooling\nExplicitly names “cooling” or “moving heat” or decreasing the temperature of an object as a primary function or activity of the device\n\n\n\nFrequency\nComments on how often a device is used in day-to-day living, excluding references to their own ownership\n\n\n\nGraphics\nNames producing graphics on a screen as a primary function or activity of the device\n\n\n\nHeating\nExplicitly names heating or increasing the temperature of [air, water, or objects] as a primary function or activity of the device\n\n\n\nInformation processing\nNames computing/processing data/information/signals as a primary function or activity of the device\n\n\n\nLighting\nNames generating light as a primary function or activity of the device\n\n\n\nMotion/compression\nReferences moving components (e.g., a spinning washing machine drum) or compression as part of the operation of a device\n\n\n\nSound\nIdentifies making sound as a primary function or activity of the device\n\n\n\nSpeed\nComments on the speed/rate with which a device performs its primary function or activity\n\n\n\nTask size\nComments on the amount, difficulty, or degree of concentration of work that a device does.

Given this study’s sample of 30 experts, the effect size would have needed to be 0.45 or so to have a reasonable chance of detecting a significant correlation between the various measure of expert performance on the estimation task and experts’ self-assessed relevance of their expertise (see Section 3.1).\n\n\nCorrectness as a Function of Wattage Proximity\nTo test whether expert performance on the choice task was dependent on the magnitude of difference between devices, we examined the correlation between these two terms. Expert performance was measured in terms of the number of experts (out of 30) who correctly selected the appliance with the lowest energy use. Wattage difference was assessed by taking the logarithmic difference between the device with the second-lowest wattage and the device with the lowest wattage within each choice set (see Table S1 below). The correlation between expert performance and wattage difference (r = 0.14, p = 0.72) was small and non-significant, suggesting that expert choice performance was not dependent on the magnitude between choice wattages.\nTable S1.

We randomly allocated 1,009 participants recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to either Study 1C (estimating energy consumption) or Study 1D (estimating GHG emissions). The studies were available only to people in the United States. The materials and procedure were nearly identical to Study 1A and 1B except that the reference unit provided for energy consumption and GHG emissions was in terms of both a “medium-sized tomato” as well as the use of “a 100-watt incandescent light bulb for one hour”. Both items were said to consume 100 units of energy (in Study 1C) or emit 100 units of GHG emissions (in Study 1D).\nThe 507 participants allocated to Study 1C ranged in age from 18 to 75 years with a mean of 33.5 (SD = 10.4). Among the survey respondents, 58% were female and 70% were employed full-time or part-time. Racially, 74% were non-Hispanic White, 6% Hispanic, 8% African American, and 10% Asian. Politically, 39% identified as Democrats, 38% as Independent, and 18% as Republican.\nThe 505 participants allocated to Study 1D ranged in age from 19 to 80 years with a mean of 34.5 (SD = 11.6). Among the survey respondents, 55% were female and 70% were employed full-time or part-time. Racially, 75% were non-Hispanic White, 5% Hispanic, 9% African American, and 9% Asian. Politically, 42% identified as Democrats, 32% as Independent, and 21% as Republican.\nFigure S1 shows participants’ estimated energy used plotted against actual energy consumed after transforming both distributions with base-10 logarithms to reduce positive skew. Figure S2 shows participants’ estimated GHG emissions plotted against actual GHG emissions after transforming both distributions with base-10 logarithms to reduce positive skew. We ran the same mixed models as those reported in the main analysis. A summary of the models is provided in Table S1.\nCompared to the main studies (that provided only an appliance reference unit), the replication studies (that provided both an appliance and a food reference unit) produced lines of best fit that were steeper and with less negative intercepts. Although the size of the difference between appliances and foods was reduced it remained statistically significant, thus supporting our main conclusion that consumers underestimate foods more than appliances.\nFigure S1: Mean estimates of energy used relative to actual energy used. The red fitted line depicts the relationship between the actual energy consumed throughout the life-cycle of 18 foods (x-axis) and the estimates provided by Study 1A participants (y-axis). The blue fitted line depicts the actual energy used of 18 electrical appliances (x-axis) and the estimates provided by Study 1A participants (y-axis). Accurate estimates would produce a set of points that fall along the grey 45-degree line. As shown, participants underestimated the energy consumption of all foods and almost all appliances (with the exception of CFL light bulbs, laptop computers, and DVD players). The underestimation was greater for foods than for appliances. Note that all estimates are expressed in terms of “Energy Units” and participants were told that producing and transporting a medium-sized tomato uses 100 Energy Units. All data are logged. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.\nFigure S2: Mean estimates of GHG emitted relative to actual GHG emitted. The red fitted line depicts the relationship between the actual GHG emitted throughout the life-cycle of 18 foods (x-axis) and the estimates provided by Study 1B participants (y-axis).

The independent variable actual, which was logged and mean-centered, refers to the actual energy consumed or GHG emissions for each item. The dependent variable - estimated, which was also logged and centered relative to the mean of actual – refers to the participant’s estimated energy consumed or GHG emissions for each item. Coefficients are unstandardized. ***p &lt; 0.001, **p &lt; 0.01, *p &lt; 0.05.\nIt is worth discussing one aspect of our study that may also have affected the participant’s responses. Like previous research, we selected the energy consumed by a 100W light-bulb during one hour as a reference unit, which represents a relatively low energy consumption relative to the energy use of the items being evaluated. This low reference point is likely to have reduced overall estimates because people often make judgments that are too close to the reference point. Although the reference unit may tend to shift all estimates in aggregate, our primary focus was on the relative underestimation of food versus appliances. This inter-domain comparison is not influenced by the specific choice of reference unit. However, a potentially interesting future direction may be to examine between-domain behavior change preferences (e.g., willingness to eat less meat versus use less air conditioning).\n\n\n\nSupplementary Note 3: Actual Life-Cycle Energy Use and GHG Emissions for Different Types of Food and Appliances\nThe data sources for actual appliance energy use are shown in Table S2. The data reflect the best available information at the time of analysis. Because energy consumption of different appliances depends on its technical specifications, mode of use (e.g., a freezer will consume more electricity if doors are opened frequently), and environmental conditions (e.g., a freezer consumes more electricity if placed in a warmer room), no single estimate of power consumption is correct. In fact, several studies report ranges. However, to assess the accuracy of consumer’s perceptions of energy consumption it is necessary to have a best estimate. To get such a value, when a range was given in a source, we used the middle value. When multiple values were available from different sources, we used the arithmetic mean. We then used the arithmetic mean of all sources to produce an “actual” value.\nThe GHG emissions associated with energy consumption vary depending on the energy mix used in the power grid from which electricity is drawn, and the magnitude of energy losses in the power transmission and distribution. To obtain a best point-estimate of GHG emissions, we used the best-estimates of energy use and assumed: (a) electric power transmission resulted in a 7% loss of electricity, (b) 1.24 pounds of greenhouse gases were emitted per kWh consumed, and c) methane had 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide while nitrous oxide’s warming potential was 298 times that of carbon dioxide.\nBecause it was possible that consumers would provide an estimate of energy use and GHG emissions that deviated from our “actual” value but was nevertheless within the range of values estimated from our sources, we performed a sensitivity analysis on these values (see Supplementary Note 4).\nTable S2.

For example, energy use and GHG emissions of vegetables depend on crop type, soil characteristics, hydro climatic conditions, pest and nutrient management, the use of irrigation, number of miles traveled, type of transportation, and storage technology. Nevertheless, our study required a best estimate for each food to compare to consumer perceptions. Our best estimates on energy use and associated GHG emissions of different foods were based on data from the LCA Software & Carbon Footprint Analyzer FoodCarbonScopeTM, produced by the company CleanMetricsTM http://cleanmetrics.net/foodcarbonscope. FoodCarbonScopeTM is a web-based software tool for conducting Environmental Life Cycle Assessments of food. It provides estimates of life-cycle GHG emissions, energy use, and water use in food and beverage products, and has the largest commercially available life cycle inventory database for North American food production and processing. In May 2016 we were granted temporary access to the tool, which allowed us to search for foods that had data from multiple American sources, from which we took the arithmetic mean as our “actual” value. We estimated the serving size and serving size weight. A summary of this analysis is provided in Tables S3 and S4. Note that all values include 1,500 miles of transport by a semi-trailer.\nBecause it is possible that consumers would provide an estimate of energy use and GHG emissions that deviated from our “actual” value but was nevertheless within the range of values estimated by different sources, we performed sensitivity analysis on these values (see Supplementary Note 4).\nTable S3.

We note that the food items used in our study had a more restricted range of “actual” values (e.g., lowest energy = 93 energy units; highest energy = 1904 energy units) compared to appliances (lowest energy = 32 energy units; highest energy = 3,615 energy units), which can reduce correlations.\nIn order to examine the effect of covariates in Study 1A and 1B, we ran the same mixed-effect models as described in the main text a second time, now including all of the demographic variables (i.e., Gender [“Male” reference level], Age, Ethnicity [“Other” reference level], Education, Employment [“Homemaker” reference level], Income, Political Orientation – Economic Issues, Political Orientation – Social Issues, Political Party [“Other” reference level], NEPr (i.e., environmental worldview), and Order as covariates. A summary of the models is provided in Table S5.\nIn Study 1A, in addition to the effects described in the main analysis, there was a significant effect of NEPr indicating that estimates were higher for those who had a more pro-environmental worldview. This observation is consistent with prior research.\nIn Study 1B, in addition to the effects described in the main analysis, there was a significant effect of NEPr again indicating that estimates were higher for those who had a more pro-environmental worldview. There was a significant effect of gender indicating that estimates were higher for those who were female. This observation is consistent with some prior research (but not all). There was a significant effect of education indicating that estimates were higher for those who were more educated. There was a significant effect of income indicating that estimates were higher for those who reported a higher family income bracket.\nTable S5.

Figure S4 shows participants’ estimated GHG emissions plotted against conservative actual GHG emissions after transforming both distributions with base-10 logarithms to reduce positive skew. We ran the same mixed models as those reported in the main analysis. A summary of the models is provided in Table S6.\nCompared to the main analysis, the conservative analysis produced lines of best fit that were shallower and with less negative intercepts. Importantly, the size of the difference between appliances and foods was very similar between analyses, supporting our main conclusion that consumers underestimate foods more than appliances.\nFigure S3: Mean estimates of energy used relative to conservative actual energy used. The red fitted line depicts the relationship between the conservative actual energy consumed throughout the life-cycle of 19 foods (x-axis) and the estimates provided by Study 1A participants (y-axis).

We really do value your feedback! ____\n\n\n\nSupplementary Note 6: Study 2 - Additional Analyses\nWe conducted a regression analysis with group, NEPr, scores from the subscales of the Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ; health, mood, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, price, weight control, familiarity, animal welfare, environmental protection, political values, religion [each coded “1” for Strongly Disagree up to “5” for Strongly Agree), and the demographics variables (gender [coded “1” for Man and “2” for Woman], age, race [coded “1” for Caucasian/white, “2” for “African American/black”, 3 for Asian/pacific islander, “4” for Hispanic/Latino, “5” for Native American, and “6” for Other], employment status [coded “1” for Employed full time, etc.], education status [coded “1” for Some high school up to “6” for Graduate], political party [coded “1” for Democrat, etc.], household income [coded “0” for $0-9,999 up to “7” for $120,000+], and dietary status [coded “0” for eats red meat and “1” for avoids red meat]) entered as predictor variables, and the average number of beef soups purchased as the outcome variable.\nThe analysis revealed a significant effect of group, B = -.49, t(97) = -2.93, p = .004, a significant effect of diet type, B = -1.14, t(97) = -5.038, p &lt; .0001, a significant effect for the political values FCQ subscale, B = -.31, t(97) = -2.181, p = .03, a significant effect for the religion FCQ subscale, B = .25, t(97) = 3.01, p = .03, a significant effect for the environmental protection FCQ subscale, B = .34, t(97) = -2.18, p = .03, and a significant effect of education, B = -.153, t(97) = -2.21, p = .03. In sum, those less likely to purchase cans of beef soup were presented with the GHG emissions information, more educated, have a diet that excluded red meat, and self-reported to choose foods that were aligned with their religious, political, and environmental protection values.\nWe conducted another regression analysis with the same variables entered as predictor variables, and beef-to-vegetable soup GHG emissions ratio purchased as the outcome variable. This analysis once again excluded to two outliers who produced ratios more than six standard deviations from the mean. The analysis revealed a significant effect of group, B = 1.30, t(95) = 3.14, p = .002. No other variables were significant predictors. In sum, those who tended to estimate a higher ratio were presented with the GHG emissions information.\n\n\n\nSupplementary Note 7: Actual Life-Cycle GHG Emissions for a Range of Prepared Soups\nFor Study 2, the actual values of GHG emissions from the life-cycle of different types of vegetable and beef soup were based on data from the website www.eatlowcarbon.org/food-scores, which was last accessed 23 November 2017. According to this website: &gt; EatLowCarbon.org was created by Bon Appétit Management Company, a food service pioneer operating hundreds of cafés all over America for corporations, universities, and specialty venues. Bon Appétit is known for tackling pressing social issues such as local food, animal welfare, antibiotics in animal agriculture, farmworker rights, and more. Bon Appétit worked with the nonprofit environmental group Ecotrust to compile and conduct peer-reviewed Life Cycle Assessments from which the information on this site is drawn. Researchers use LCA to calculate the environmental impact of a product’s entire life cycle: for food items, that includes the inputs, such as fertilizer, that went into growing it, and the energy that went into transporting, processing and cooking it.\nAccording to an email correspondence with Bon Appétit: &gt; We hired the organization EcoTrust to compile peer reviewed Life Cycle Assessments for single-ingredient foods and combine them according to “recipes” for the dishes shown on the site. That includes the ingredients, how far they traveled (either “domestic” or “international”) and information about how they were cooked.\nThe EatLowCarbon.org website listed the following soups: * Beef Chili Soup – 1,281 grams of CO2e * Chicken Noodle Soup – 253 grams of CO2e * Minestrone Soup – 189 grams of CO2e * Vegetarian Chili – 86 grams of CO2e * Spinach and Pea Stew – 78 grams of CO2e * Three Bean Soup – 54 grams of CO2e * Lentil Soup - 54 grams of CO2e\nIn order to generate the values used in Study 2, we took the value for Beef Chili Soup (1,281 g CO2e) and added/subtracted 10% of it (i.e., 128) to create two new values: 1,153 and 1,409. We then allocated these three values to the three beef soups used in the study: * Beef Noodle Soup – 1,409 grams of CO2e * Beef with Vegetables and Barley Soup – 1,153 grams of CO2e * Vegetable Beef Soup – 1,281 grams of CO2e\nSimilarly, we took the value for Minestrone Soup (189 g CO2e) and added/subtracted 10% of it (i.e., 19) to create two new values: 170 and 208. We then allocated these three values to the three vegetable soups used in the study: * Vegetarian Vegetable Soup – 208 grams of CO2e * Old Fashioned Vegetable Soup – 170 grams of CO2e * Minestrone Soup – 189 grams of CO2e\n\n\nReferences (Supplementary Material)\n\nAttari, S.

    "text": "SI Text\nSI Methods. Data sources and values of actual energy consumption and savings. The data sources for actual energy use are shown in Tables S1-S4. The data reflect the best available information at the time of analysis. When multiple values were available, we used the arithmetic mean. Multilevel regression models. In each domain (e.g., household devices and activities), we fit two primary models. Model 1 was used to investigate the basic relationship between perceived and actual energy use and savings. Model 2 was used to explore which individualdifference variables (e.g., numeracy, proenvironmental attitudes) account for differences in the accuracy of participants’ perceptions. All models were fit using the restricted maximum likelihood method in SAS PROC MIXED, with unstructured covariance matrices and with empirical (robust) SEs for \\(t\\) tests of fixed effects.\nHousehold devices and activities. For household devices and activities, Model 1 was as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\log 10 \\text { Perception }_{i j}=} & \\left(\\gamma_{00}+u_{0 j}\\right)+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{i} \\\\\n& +\\gamma_{20}\\left(\\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{i}\\right)^{2}+r_{i j}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis model is the same as that in Eq. 1 of the main text, with the following substitutions:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\beta_{0 j}=\\gamma_{00}+u_{0 j} \\\\\n& \\beta_{1 j}=\\gamma_{10}+u_{1 j} \\\\\n& \\beta_{2 j}=\\gamma_{20} .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn these equations, \\(\\gamma_{00}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{10}\\) are the average intercept (elevation) and slope, respectively, \\(u_{0 j}\\) is the random deviation of participant \\(j\\) ’s intercept from the average intercept, \\(u_{1 j}\\) is the random deviation of participant \\(j\\) ’s slope from the average slope, and \\(r_{i j}\\) is the level- 1 error. In contrast to \\(\\beta_{0 j}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1 j}\\), the coefficient \\(\\beta_{2 j}\\) for the quadratic term was treated as fixed rather than random, because its estimated variance was not significantly different from zero in model 1 and because its estimated variance was zero in model 2 . In the main text, the reported means \\(M\\left(\\beta_{0 j}\\right), M\\left(\\beta_{1 j}\\right)\\), and \\(M\\left(\\beta_{2 j}\\right)\\) refer to the estimated values of the average coefficients \\(\\widehat{\\gamma}_{00}, \\widehat{\\gamma}_{10}\\), and \\(\\widehat{\\gamma}_{20}\\), respectively.\nModel 2 for household devices and activities incorporated the effects of the 16 individual-difference variables on the intercept and slope as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&{\\log 10 \\text { Perception }_{i j}=}\\left(\\gamma_{00}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{0 k} z_{k j}+u_{0 j}\\right) \\\\\n&+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{1 k} z_{k j}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 A^{\\prime} \\text { ctual } \\\\\n& i\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn this equation, the \\(z_{k} \\mathrm{~s}\\) are the individual-difference variables, with each participant \\(j\\) having his or her own value on each variable. Again, this model is the same as that in Eq. 1 of the main text, but with the following substitutions:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\beta_{0 j}=\\gamma_{00}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{0 k} z_{k j}+u_{0 j} \\\\\n\\beta_{1 j}=\\gamma_{10}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{1 k} z_{k j}+u_{1 j} \\\\\n\\beta_{2 j}=\\gamma_{20}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nThus, the first summation in Eq. \\(\\mathbf{S} 2\\) represents the main effects of the individual-difference variables on the elevation (intercept), whereas the second summation represents the effects of these variables on the \\(\\log 10\\) Actual slope (i.e., the interactions between the \\(z_{k} \\mathrm{~s}\\) and \\(\\left.\\log 10 \\mathrm{Actual}\\right)\\). Because the \\(z_{k} \\mathrm{~s}\\) were centered, they do not affect the average values of \\(\\beta_{0 j}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1 j}\\) :\nAutomobiles. For automobile-related activities, we recentered \\(\\log 10\\) Actual and omitted the quadratic term. The resulting models 1 and 2 were as follows:\n\\[\n{\\log 10 \\text { Perception }_{i j}}=\\left(\\gamma_{00}+u_{0 j}\\right)+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{i}+r_{i j}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&{\\log 10 \\text { Perception }_{i j}=}\\left(\\gamma_{00}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{0 k} z_{k j}+u_{0 j}\\right) \\\\\n&+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{1 k} z_{k j}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{i}+r_{i j}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTransportation modes and beverage containers. For the transportation of goods, participants provided ranks rather than quantitative estimates. Because the average rank was necessarily 2.5 (the mean of \\(1,2,3\\), and 4 ), we did not estimate the intercept or the main effects of the individual-difference variables. We recentered \\(\\log 10\\) Actual and omitted the quadratic term. The models for beverage containers were identical to those for transportation modes, except that we again recentered \\(\\log 10\\) Actual. Here are models 1 and 2 for the ranking tasks:\n\\[\n\\text { PerceptionRank }_{i j}=2.5+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10 \\text { Actual }_{l i}+r_{i j}\n\\]\nPerceptionRank \\(_{i j}=2.5+\\left(\\gamma_{10}+\\sum_{k=1}^{16} \\gamma_{1 k} z_{k j}+u_{1 j}\\right) \\log 10\\) Actual \\(_{i}+r_{i j}\\).\nDistributions of elevations and slopes. In multilevel modeling, the predicted value of each participant’s intercept or slope is a weighted average of the intercept or slope from the appropriate model (e.g., S1-S6) and the intercept or slope from that participant’s own ordinary least squares regression. The Inset in Fig. 1 in the main text shows the predicted regression curves for perceived energy use and savings for household devices and activities (based on model 1 in Eq. S1) for 30 randomly selected participants. These curves indicate substantial variability in both elevations (intercepts) and slopes, and also suggest that some participants had particularly high or low elevations or slopes. Model 2 was intended to explain some of this variability by incorporating individual differences.\nFor each of our four tasks, descriptive statistics for the distributions of predicted elevations and slopes for model 2 appear in\nTable S5. These predicted values of \\(\\beta_{0 j}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1 j}\\) reflect the effects of the individual-difference variables in Eqs. S2, S4, and S6. The descriptive statistics indicate substantial variability across participants, as well as the presence of at least some outliers (participants with particularly high or low elevations or slopes). Even so, the vast majority of participants had elevations that were too low in the analysis of household devices and activities and slopes that were too low in all four analyses.\nDistributions of random effects and level-1 errors. Statistical tests in multilevel models assume that the random intercept deviations \\(u_{0 j}\\), the random slope deviations \\(u_{1 j}\\), and the level- 1 errors \\(r_{i j}\\) are normally distributed. For household devices and activities and for automobiles, histograms and normal probability plots indicated that these distributions had somewhat thick tails, with occasional outliers. Thick tails were not a problem in models of participants’ ranks for transportation modes and beverage containers.\nWe investigated the effects of outliers and nonnormality on our results in several ways. First, deleting participants with extreme estimates for \\(u_{0 j}\\), extreme estimates for \\(u_{1 j}\\), or high Cook’s D values had no effect on statistical tests related to our primary conclusions (i.e., tests of intercepts, Log10Actual and its square, numeracy, NEP, and environmental behaviors). However, some minor results did change. For example, removing four participants with high Cook’s D values in model 2 for household devices and activities yielded a significant main effect of age ( \\(P=0.036\\) rather than 0.099 ), a significant effect of “Uses more energy than average” on slope ( \\(P=0.002\\) rather than 0.075 ), and a nonsignificant effect of “Could not vote” on slope ( \\(P=0.084\\) rather than 0.048). Second, using model-based SEs rather than empirical (robust) SEs also had very minor effects, with tests of “Voted Republican,” “Chose not to vote,” and “Could not vote” changing from barely significant to not quite significant. (Robust SEs, which we used in our primary analyses, are preferred when normality is a concern.) Finally, a nonlinear transformation designed to bring in the tails of the log10Perception distribution (the signed square root of the absolute deviation from the mean of \\(\\log 10\\) Perception) resolved the normality issues while leaving our key results unchanged, although again there were a few changes for borderline results. We investigated our other models using similar methods. Overall, the results indicate that our primary conclusions are not sensitive to outliers or to violations of normality assumptions. Modeled variance. It would be useful to know how much of the within-participant and between-participant variation in perceptions of energy use and savings is explained by the predictor variables in Eqs. S1-S6. However, issues regarding explained variance in multilevel models are complicated by the fact that the estimated variance components do not map nicely onto the traditional distinction between within-participant and betweenparticipant variation (1, 2).\nWe took two approaches to modeling explained variance. In the first approach, we estimated the proportions of the variances of the random intercept term \\(u_{0 j}\\), the random slope term \\(u_{1 j}\\), and the level-1 error \\(r_{i j}\\) that were accounted for by the predictor variables (2). These variances are \\(\\tau_{00}, \\tau_{11}\\), and \\(\\sigma^{2}\\), respectively. Estimating the proportions of \\(\\tau_{00}\\) and \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) explained required that we also fit a null model with no predictors (model 0 ). The proportion of level- 1 error variance explained by model 1 relative to model 0 (for example) is given by the following expression:\n\\[\n\\left(\\sigma_{\\text {Model0 }}^{2}-\\sigma_{\\text {Model1 }}^{2}\\right) / \\sigma_{\\text {Model0 }}^{2}\n\\]\nResults for the comparisons of interest appear in Table S6. The row for \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) indicates that the inclusion of Log10Actual (and its square, if present) in model 1 reduced the estimated level- 1 error variance by a modest amount, although the reduction for beverage containers was rather small. The two entries in the \\(\\tau_{00}\\) row indicate that including the individual-difference variables as predictors in model 2 did little to reduce variation in participants’ elevations. The entries in the \\(\\tau_{11}\\) row are somewhat higher, although still modest, indicating that the individualdifference variables did a better job of accounting for variation in participants’ Log10Actual slopes. In our second approach, we used Snijders and Bosker’s (1) method to calculate an \\(R^{2}\\) value for each level of model 2, omitting the random component of the Log10Actual slope, as suggested by those authors:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nR_{\\text {Level1 }}^{2}=\\frac{\\left(\\sigma^{2}+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model0 }}-\\left(\\sigma^{2}+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model2 }}}{\\left(\\sigma^{2}+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model0 }}} \\\\\nR_{\\text {Level2 }}^{2}=\\frac{\\left(\\left(\\sigma^{2} / n\\right)+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model0 }}-\\left(\\left(\\sigma^{2} / n\\right)+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model2 }}}{\\left(\\left(\\sigma^{2} / n\\right)+\\tau_{00}\\right)_{\\text {Model0 }}}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nFor household devices and activities and for automobiles, both \\(R^{2}\\) values are relatively low because the individual-difference variables did a poor job of reducing \\(\\tau_{00}\\) (Table S6). For transporting goods and for beverage containers, the level-1 and level- \\(2 R^{2} \\mathrm{~s}\\) are equal because \\(\\tau_{00}=0\\). We find the results of our first approach more interpretable. Although it is possible that other individual-difference variables might improve predictions, we suspect that much of the unexplained variation in participants’ perceptions reflects idiosyncratic factors (e.g., familiarity or experience with different devices) and random error. SI Discussion. Expanded discussion of flat slopes. This section provides a more extensive discussion of the possible reasons for the flat slopes in Figs. 1 and 2 (main text) As noted in the main text, it is helpful to recall that (ignoring any quadratic relationship) the simple slope of the relationship between \\(\\log 10\\) Perception and \\(\\log 10\\) Actual is equal to the product of the Pearson correlation and the ratio of the two SDs: \\(b=r\\left(s_{\\mathrm{Y}} / s_{\\mathrm{X}}\\right)\\). In our primary analysis, these two components contributed roughly equally to the flat slope, with mean values of 0.51 for \\(r\\) and 0.53 for \\(s_{\\mathrm{Y}} / s_{\\mathrm{X}}\\). Considering the ratio of SDs first, participants’ estimates of energy use and savings were greatly compressed relative to the actual values. This compression almost certainly resulted from an anchoring bias (3-5) in which the reference point provided in the task served as an anchor for participants’ estimates, causing those estimates to be too similar to the reference point. Substantial research (reviewed in ref. 4) indicates that such effects occur because the anchor preferentially activates anchor-consistent information in memory. Anchoring is unrelated to regression toward the mean, which is reflected in the imperfect correlation. Because we used a relatively low reference point in our primary task (a 100-W light bulb used for 1 h ), anchoring would be expected to lead to underestimation of energy use and savings on average. We observed exactly this result. Although it would be possible to eliminate this underestimation (or even generate overestimation) by using a higher reference point, we selected the light-bulb reference point because it was the most understandable to participants in our pilot tests. Indeed, the ease with which people recall information about the energy used by incandescent light bulbs suggests that these bulbs may serve as natural reference points when people make judgments about household energy use and savings in the real world. If this inference is correct, then the observed underestimation of household energy use and savings should generalize beyond our survey procedures. We also used an easily understood reference point for the automobile-related activities in Fig. \\(2 A\\) (main text), but because that reference point was near the center of the range, anchoring effects (although present) did not lead to under- or overestimation on average. Finally, anchoring effects play no role in Fig. \\(2 B\\) and \\(C\\) (main text) because reference points were not provided and because the ranking tasks ensured that \\(s_{\\mathrm{Y}} / s_{\\mathrm{X}}\\) equaled the correct value for each participant (i.e., participants could not compress their ranks).\nAdditional evidence for anchoring also comes from Fig. \\(2 A\\) (main text). We noted in the main text that the energy saved by reducing one’s highway speed from 70 to 60 miles per hour on a \\(60-\\) mile trip was overestimated, consistent with the relatively small amount of energy saved ( 0.4 gallons of gasoline). However, had an activity in Fig. 1 (main text) used or saved that much energy (13,480 Wh ), we would have expected an underestimate rather than an overestimate. We attribute this difference to the fact that the reference points in the two tasks differed by a factor of 1,000 (the reference activity for the automobile questions used 3 gallons of gas, or approximately 101 kWh , compared with 100 Wh for the electricity questions). These results are consistent with an anchoring explanation for the compression of energy perceptions (35) and with the results of Lichtenstein et al. (6), who noted that quantitative fatality estimates were higher, but still relatively flat, when a larger reference point was used.\nTurning to the imperfect correlation between \\(\\log 10\\) Perception and \\(\\log 10\\) Actual, there are several plausible reasons (in addition to random error in reported perceptions) for \\(r\\) to be less than 1 . For example, participants may have imagined specific examples of devices or appliances, such as their own air conditioners, whose energy consumption in fact differed from our Actual values. Such idiosyncrasies would degrade individuals’ correlations even if our actual values were accurate for the average participant. Alternatively, participants may have failed to consider some factors that are related to actual energy consumption and savings (e.g., the volume of air cooled by a central air conditioner usually far exceeds that cooled by a room air conditioner).\nPerceptions may also have been affected by systematic biases that mimic random error when they are not modeled. One intriguing possibility is that perceptions of energy use differ from\n\nSnijders T, Bosker R (1999) Multilevel Analysis: An Introduction to Basic and Advanced Multilevel Modeling (Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA).\nRaudenbush S, Bryk A (2002) Hierarchical Linear Models: Applications and Data Analysis Methods (Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA), 2nd Ed.\nPoulton EC (1994) Behavioral Decision Theory: A New Approach (Cambridge Univ Press, New York).\nChapman G, Johnson E (2002) Incorporating the irrelevant: Anchors in judgments of belief and value.

To test this possibility, we augmented the model in Eq. S1 by adding a contrast code that differentiated energy use and energy savings, along with the interaction between this code and \\(\\log 10\\) Actual. The average coefficients for the two new predictors were both positive, indicating greater elevation and slope for energy use than for energy savings (i.e., more accurate perceptions for energy use), both \\(t \\mathrm{~s} \\geq 8.99\\), both \\(P s&lt;0.0001\\). Although it is tempting to interpret these results as a framing effect \\((7,8)\\), we are hesitant to do so because the use and savings activities were not matched. In the most closely matched comparison, the perceived energy used by an electric dryer \\((M=242 \\mathrm{~Wh})\\) exceeded the perceived energy saved by linedrying clothes \\((M=160 \\mathrm{~Wh})\\left[t(482)=8.16, P&lt;0.0001, \\eta^{2}=0.12\\right]\\). A more general explanation for the imperfect relationship is that, to the extent that people make energy comparisons at all, they may do so within rather than across categories of devices (e.g., they compare different models of air conditioners rather than comparing air conditioners to computers). Consumers have not routinely been provided with cross-category information like that in Gardner and Stern’s (9) short list. Indeed, energy-efficiency labels on products from washing machines to automobiles highlight within-category rather than cross-category comparisons. As a result, some facts about relative energy consumption (e.g., that a dishwasher uses much more energy than a typical room air conditioner in 1 h ) can be surprising. Of course, people do sometimes make choices across categories, at least implicitly (e.g., deciding to replace an old furnace with a more efficient one rather than installing a programmable thermostat or adding additional insulation in the attic). Similarly, consumers sometimes choose between air and ground shipping for small items, although they do not typically decide whether goods should be shipped by train or truck. However, consumers with the relevant knowledge might react favorably to a shipping company that advertises that they transport goods by rail rather than by truck.\nTversky A, Kahneman D (1974) Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases.

    "text": "Study ideas\nhttps://gemini.google.com/app/1618628a009fdfed\nHere are some cognitive psychology experiment study ideas involving human interaction with LLMs and energy-related decision-making, based on the provided document:\nParticipant as Advisor, AI as Client\n\nAdvising an LLM Client: HHave the participant take on the role of an energy advisor. Their task is to convince an LLM, acting as the client, how to change its current (simulated) behavior to reduce energy use most effectively. You could manipulate the LLM client’s characteristics (e.g., receptiveness to advice, stated budget constraints, lifestyle) and measure the participant’s advising strategies and effectiveness.\nCollaborative Planning with AI Assistant: TThe participant acts as an energy advisor but works with an LLM assistant to create energy plans for clients (who could be hypothetical or simulated). The study could manipulate the quality of the LLM assistant’s plans (e.g., consistently good vs. inconsistent/poor). Measures could include the quality of the final plan, participant satisfaction, and how participants decide to use or override the LLM assistant’s help.\nLLM-Mediated Information Seeking: Participants perform an energy planning task and can interact with an LLM chatbot to ask questions about appliance usage, energy units, or saving tips. The study could examine how the availability of this LLM resource influences planning accuracy and strategy, particularly when the initial energy reduction goals are presented in different formats (like kWh, $, or %)\n\nAI as Client & AI as Planner/Advisor (with Participant Interaction)\n\nComparing Plans: Participants create their own energy reduction plan for a given scenario[cite: 296, 425]. They are then presented with an alternative plan generated by an LLM planner[cite: 296]. Participants must choose which plan to implement (their own or the LLM’s) or perhaps integrate aspects of both[cite: 296, 425]. This setup allows investigation into factors influencing trust, perceived competence of the AI, and potential over/under-reliance[cite: 426, 428]. The complexity of the planning problem or the manipulated quality/bias of the AI’s plan could be varied[cite: 296].\nCollaborative Planning with LLM Partner: Pair a human participant with an LLM agent to collaboratively create an energy plan[cite: 339, 340, 341]. The LLM could offer suggestions, ask clarifying questions, or present information in different formats to assist the human[cite: 340, 343]. Analyzing the interaction dynamics and the final plan’s quality could reveal how different information formats are utilized in collaboration and the LLM’s effectiveness as a planning tool[cite: 344, 345, 346].\nMulti-Step Workflow with LLM: Use a more complex task, like composite fact-checking related to energy claims, where participants work with an LLM through a multi-step workflow[cite: 278, 279, 280]. This allows examining appropriate reliance at a finer granularity, assessing how users interact with intermediate LLM steps versus just a final output[cite: 281, 282]. This could be adapted to energy planning by breaking the planning down into sub-goals or stages where LLM assistance is provided.\n\nIII. Understanding Cognitive Representations\n\nIdentifying Dimensions: Present energy data in various formats (tables, graphs)[cite: 429]. Ask participants to identify key dimensions (e.g., appliance, time) and weight their importance[cite: 430, 431]. This probes mental models of energy consumption[cite: 433, 434].\nAbstraction Levels: Ask participants to create energy plans at different levels: concrete (specific kWh per appliance) versus abstract (target temperatures, usage hours)[cite: 435, 436]. Measure time, difficulty, and plan quality to understand hierarchical reasoning in this context[cite: 437, 438, 439].\nLLM Analysis of Reasoning: After a planning task, ask participants to explain their strategies in writing[cite: 403]. Use an LLM to analyze these explanations for themes, difficulties, and strategy differences related to how the task information was presented (e.g., goal in kWh vs. % vs. USD)[cite: 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410].\n\n\nStudy ideas\nFunction learning or judgement paradigm - with household appliances. Learning some general principles about how much energy items use, and then testing on novel objects - manipulate direct energy judgements vs. money saving. - before or after the utility planning task?\nConnect to literature on forecasting?\nSimulating the existing representation study manipulations with LLM’s - Then seeing how different prompts or framing influence performance\nStudying what representations people use when thinking about energy - The dimensions of a heating bill - The dimensions (and weights) of electricity from appliances\nTask of listing as many things as possible that someone could do to reduce their energy bill - with AI assistance, or without\nParticipant takes the role of energy advisor - convincing llm client how to reduce their energy use\nParticipant takes the role of energy advisor - working with an llm assistant to create energy plans for clients - Some llm assistants create really good plans, others don’t - Using the llm to decide how best to help the client\nReward function that’s optimized within certain bounds of appliance type use (e.g., if heat goes too low, reward plummets)\nPlans at different layers of abstraction - setting kwh per appliance - explicitly setting temperature average, and appliance hour usage amounts\nThe problem of creating a plan to influence some variable (e.g., utility bill) - identifying the relevant dimensions - Assigning weight to the dimensions\nAbility to adjust plans based on added context. - e.g., the Meyers family wants to keep their energy bill the same -but Mr. Meyer needs to start working from home - and will need to use more energy to run his power tools. Make adjustments to their plan that will accomodate this change - while also maintaining their current energy costs.\n\nWays of integrating AI into a study on energy use\n\nParticipant plays role of advisor, tells ‘AI client’ how to most effectively change current behavior\n\nAI generated feedback on advice?\n\nParticipants choose between their own plan, and an AI’s alternative plan\n\nManipulate what type of energy plan problems AI’s are good for\nAssess overreliance/undereliance tendencies\nWhether the tendency to over or under rely depends on complexity of problem\n\n\nThings a LLM could do in the context of an experimental psychology task? - Custom feedback - summarize (and critique) user response patterns at trial or block level"

    "text": "NB_LLM-1\nhttps://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/b9b3533c-ddc0-49e3-b438-9e1f05272f9e?pli=1\n\nSuggest possible follow up studies, which investigate similar questions, but incorporate a large language model (llm) component in addition to human subjects.\n\nBuilding upon the hypothetical study that examined the impact of numerical representations of energy reduction goals (kWh, %, USD) on planning accuracy, incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) component opens several exciting avenues for future research. These studies could delve deeper into the cognitive processes involved in energy planning, explore personalized information delivery, and enhance the ecological validity of the research. Here are some possible follow-up studies:\n1. Investigating LLM-Mediated Information Seeking and Planning:\n\nStudy Design: Replicate the original study’s design, but allow participants in all conditions to interact with an LLM-powered chatbot during the planning task. The chatbot could be designed to answer questions about appliance energy consumption, clarify the meaning of different units (kWh, %, USD), or provide general energy-saving tips.\nLLM Functionality: The chatbot’s responses could be tailored to the information format the participant is currently working with. For example, if a participant is in the percentage condition and asks about an appliance’s energy use, the chatbot could provide an estimate in terms of percentage of total household consumption or, if asked directly, in kWh. The interaction logs with the chatbot would be recorded.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDoes the availability of an LLM-powered information resource mediate the effect of information format on planning accuracy? For instance, do participants in the percentage or USD conditions who utilize the chatbot more effectively achieve higher accuracy?\nWhat types of questions do participants ask the chatbot in each information format condition? Do the questions reveal different levels of understanding or different cognitive challenges associated with each format?\nCan the LLM identify common misconceptions or errors in participants’ planning strategies based on their queries?\nDoes interacting with an LLM influence participants’ perceived difficulty of the planning task or their confidence in their plan?\n\nConnection to Sources: This design aligns with research on Persuasive Conversational Agents (PCAs) for sustainability and the potential of LLMs to enhance user engagement and support decision-making. The study could also draw on work exploring user experience with LLM-based assistants. Analyzing the types of questions asked could provide insights into cognitive accessibility of different units.\n\n2. Personalized Information Formatting with LLMs:\n\nStudy Design: Begin by assessing participants’ energy literacy and their preferred format for receiving energy information (e.g., through a pre-study questionnaire). Then, replicate the original planning task, but allow an LLM to dynamically adjust the format in which information is presented based on the participant’s stated preferences or their demonstrated understanding during an initial planning stage (e.g., if they struggle with percentages, the LLM could offer information in kWh).\nLLM Functionality: The LLM would act as an adaptive interface, using natural language understanding to interpret user difficulties and employing natural language generation to present information in alternative formats. The system could track which formats are most frequently utilized or seem to correlate with improved planning.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDoes providing energy information in participants’ preferred format, facilitated by an LLM, lead to greater planning accuracy?\nCan an LLM effectively identify when a participant is struggling with a particular format and suggest or switch to a more comprehensible one?\nDo participants demonstrate improved planning accuracy over time as the LLM adapts the information format?\nHow do participants perceive an energy planning tool that personalizes information format based on their needs?\n\nConnection to Sources: This study connects to the idea of flexible program designs and personalized approaches in feedback programs. It also relates to research on cognitive fluency and how fluent framing can influence decision-making. The LLM’s role in adapting information formats aligns with the concept of tailoring interventions to end-user characteristics.\n\n3. LLM as a Simulated Household and Feedback Provider:\n\nStudy Design: Human participants create an energy reduction plan (in one of the three formats). This plan is then “submitted” to an LLM that has been trained to simulate the energy consumption of a virtual household matching one of the scenarios from the original study (e.g., the Smith family in Texas). The LLM, based on its understanding of typical appliance usage and the participant’s proposed plan, would then generate realistic feedback on the likely energy savings, potential challenges, or areas where the plan might be less effective.\nLLM Functionality: The LLM’s feedback would be provided in natural language and could relate back to the original goal format (kWh, %, or USD). It could also ask clarifying questions or suggest alternative strategies. Participants would then have the opportunity to revise their plan based on the LLM’s feedback.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDoes receiving feedback from an LLM-simulated household on their energy plan improve the accuracy of participants’ revised plans?\nIs the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback moderated by the initial information format in which the reduction goal was presented?\nWhat aspects of the LLM’s feedback (e.g., its specificity, the language used) are perceived as most helpful by participants?\nDoes interacting with an LLM simulating a real-world context enhance the perceived ecological validity of the planning task?\n\nConnection to Sources: This design incorporates the concept of LLM agents imitating human behavior and their potential for creating believable simulations. It also aligns with the vast body of research on feedback in energy conservation, with the LLM acting as a sophisticated feedback provider. The use of simulated households could address some ecological validity concerns.\n\n4. LLM for Generating and Evaluating Planning Scenarios:\n\nStudy Design: Utilize an LLM to create a wider and more diverse set of household scenarios, varying in demographics, climate, appliance ownership, and baseline energy consumption. Human participants would then perform the energy planning task for a subset of these LLM-generated scenarios, with the reduction goal presented in one of the three formats. Subsequently, a separate LLM could be trained to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of the participants’ plans for each scenario.\nLLM Functionality: The scenario-generating LLM would need to be prompted to create realistic and coherent household descriptions. The evaluation LLM would need to be trained on principles of energy consumption and savings to assess the plausibility of the proposed plans.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDoes the effect of information format on planning accuracy generalize across a wider range of household scenarios generated by an LLM?\nCan an LLM be effectively used to automate the evaluation of energy conservation plans, providing a more scalable approach to research in this area?\nAre there specific types of scenarios (e.g., those with more complex appliance configurations) where certain information formats lead to greater accuracy, as identified by the LLM evaluation?\nHow does the consistency and reliability of LLM-generated scenario evaluations compare to human expert evaluations?\n\nConnection to Sources: This approach leverages the LLM’s ability to generate diverse textual data to enhance the scope and generalizability of the study. The use of an LLM for evaluation aligns with research exploring LLMs as evaluators in educational contexts.\n\n5. Combining Quantitative Planning with Qualitative Explanations Analyzed by LLMs:\n\nStudy Design: Replicate the original study, but after completing the planning task, ask participants to explain their reasoning and the strategies they used to achieve the reduction goal in an open-ended text box. These qualitative responses would then be analyzed using an LLM.\nLLM Functionality: The LLM could be used to identify common themes, strategies, and difficulties expressed by participants in each information format condition. It could also assess the coherence and understanding reflected in their explanations.\nResearch Questions:\n\nDo the qualitative explanations provided by participants reveal different cognitive processes or challenges associated with planning in kWh, percentage, or USD?\nCan an LLM identify a correlation between the strategies described by participants and their planning accuracy in each condition?\nAre there systematic differences in the language used by participants in each condition when explaining their planning process?\nDo participants in the kWh condition provide more concrete or appliance-specific explanations compared to those in percentage or USD conditions?\n\nConnection to Sources: This study utilizes the LLM’s natural language processing capabilities for qualitative data analysis, offering deeper insights into the “why” behind the quantitative results. This approach is similar to using narratives to understand preferences and complements the quantitative measures of planning accuracy.\n\nBy integrating LLMs into studies investigating the impact of information format on energy planning, researchers can gain a more nuanced understanding of the cognitive processes involved, explore personalized interventions, and potentially enhance the scalability and ecological validity of their findings. These follow-up studies can contribute significantly to the development of more effective strategies for communicating energy information and promoting residential energy conservation.\nI. Energy Plan Creation & AI Assistance\n\nIdea 1: Collaborative Energy Planning\n\nDesign: Participants are tasked with creating an energy reduction plan for a hypothetical household. They are randomly assigned to one of three conditions:\n\nControl: Participants plan alone.\nAI Assistant (Good): Participants collaborate with an AI assistant that consistently generates high-quality, feasible energy-saving suggestions.\nAI Assistant (Poor): Participants collaborate with an AI assistant that generates inconsistent, sometimes impractical suggestions.\n\nMeasures:\n\nQuality of energy plans (e.g., feasibility, potential savings, comprehensiveness).\nUser satisfaction with the AI assistant.\nCognitive load experienced during planning (e.g., self-reported ratings, physiological measures).\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study explores the impact of AI assistance on human decision-making, specifically in the context of complex, multi-faceted tasks like energy planning. It touches on concepts like cognitive offloading, where humans rely on external tools to reduce cognitive burden, and human-AI collaboration, examining how effectively humans and AI can work together to achieve a common goal.\n\nIdea 2: Trust and Reliance on AI Energy Advisors\n\nDesign: Participants are presented with energy-saving recommendations generated by an AI advisor. The AI’s performance is manipulated (e.g., consistently accurate, sometimes inaccurate, always provides justifications for recommendations). Participants choose between following the AI’s advice or creating their own plan.\nMeasures:\n\nAcceptance rate of AI recommendations.\nPerceived trustworthiness and competence of the AI advisor.\nQuality of participant-generated plans (when they choose not to follow the AI).\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study investigates the factors influencing trust in AI systems, particularly in domains with personal and financial implications like energy use. It also explores the potential for over-reliance on AI, and the conditions under which humans might critically evaluate AI-generated advice.\n\n\nII. Representations of Energy Use\n\nIdea 3: Dimensions of Energy Consumption\n\nDesign: Participants are presented with various representations of energy consumption data (e.g., numerical tables, graphs, visualizations). They are asked to identify the key dimensions of energy use (e.g., appliance type, time of day, season) and assign weights to their importance.\nMeasures:\n\nAccuracy and completeness of identified dimensions.\nAssigned weights to different dimensions.\nSubjective ratings of the clarity and usefulness of different representations.\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study examines how humans conceptualize and represent complex information like energy consumption. It explores the role of mental models and data visualization in shaping understanding and decision-making.\n\nIdea 4: Abstraction Levels in Energy Planning\n\nDesign: Participants are asked to create energy plans at different levels of abstraction:\n\nConcrete: Specifying kWh usage for each appliance.\nAbstract: Setting target average temperatures and appliance usage hours.\n\nMeasures:\n\nTime taken to complete the plan at each level.\nPerceived difficulty and confidence in the plans.\nQuality of the plans (e.g., feasibility, potential savings).\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study investigates the cognitive processes involved in hierarchical reasoning and problem-solving. It explores how humans navigate between different levels of abstraction when making complex decisions, and the trade-offs involved in each approach.\n\n\nIII. AI Feedback and Decision-Making\n\nIdea 5: AI Feedback on Energy Plans\n\nDesign: Participants create energy plans. They are then randomly assigned to receive feedback from an AI assistant:\n\nPositive Feedback: The AI praises the plan’s strengths and offers minor suggestions for improvement.\nNegative Feedback: The AI highlights weaknesses in the plan and suggests significant revisions.\nNo Feedback: Participants receive no feedback on their plan.\n\nMeasures:\n\nRevisions made to the energy plan after receiving feedback.\nSubjective ratings of the helpfulness and persuasiveness of the feedback.\nConfidence in the final energy plan.\n\nTheoretical Connection: This study examines the impact of feedback type on human learning and decision-making. It explores how people process and integrate information from AI systems, and the factors that influence their acceptance of AI-generated feedback."

(Coding: 2 point ordinal) * DEM30: For whom did you vote (Coding: 6 point ordinal)\nLatent Profile Analysis (LPA) If your data are continuous with normal-ish distributions, LPA (e.g., using the “tidyLPA” or “mclust” packages) can model the data more flexibly than K-means. It estimates how many latent subgroups exist and assigns group membership probabilistically. Longer-Form Mediation/SEM If you have theoretical pathways (e.g., knowledge → difficulty → attitude → behavior), a structural equation model (SEM) could test these sequential steps. You already have some code with the “lavaan” mediation example. Extending that to a more complete path model might be very revealing. Hotspot or Subgroup Analysis In addition to clustering, you might examine if there are meaningful thresholds on “knowledge” or “motivation” variables that matter for applied outcomes (e.g., does ELS &gt; X relate to seeing certain actions as less difficult?). A simple approach is the creation of “low vs. high” subgroups by a cut-point or quantile.\nAssessment of Current Analyses Below is a summary of the key findings and methods already performed, along with recommendations about which approaches most directly address your study’s main goals—namely, (1) assessing how different instruments relate to each other (knowledge vs. motivation measures) and (2) identifying clusters of participants who exhibit distinct knowledge–motivation profiles.\nPatterns in the Results Correlations Among Subscales The correlation matrices consistently indicate that the knowledge-based subscales (numeracy, energy-use estimates, energy-saving estimates, ELS score) tend to correlate with each other, reflecting a coherent “knowledge” dimension. Meanwhile, the motivation/attitude measures (perceived difficulty, environmental attitude, political conservatism) intercorrelate more strongly among themselves, forming a separate dimension. Nonetheless, moderate cross-correlations (e.g., environment attitude × ELS) do appear, suggesting knowledge and motivation are linked but not redundant. Factor Analyses (EFA/PCA) Factor analysis/PCA repeatedly shows that items load primarily on two factors: one dominated by knowledge-related scales, and one by motivational or attitudinal variables. This structure offers empirical support for the idea that “knowledge” vs. “motivation” are conceptually distinct constructs, even though they have modest correlations. Regression Analyses Various regressions indicate that motivation variables can predict or be predicted by knowledge measures (e.g., environment attitude is a positive predictor of ELS; perceived difficulty shows a negative association with certain knowledge scales). Some regressions add political conservatism or numeracy as control variables, improving understanding of how each knowledge measure links to attitudes. Cluster Analyses The K-means cluster analyses (and hierarchical clustering) create groupings of participants based on either (a) knowledge-only variables or (b) combined knowledge + motivation variables. When using knowledge-only variables, you can identify “low-, medium-, and high-knowledge” clusters. When you incorporate motivation variables, you see clusters that differ both in knowledge and motivation. Examining each cluster’s mean knowledge and motivation scores can reveal interesting subgroups (e.g., “High knowledge, moderate motivation”; “Low knowledge, high difficulty,” etc.). Interaction and Non-linear (GAM) Models Interaction models test whether the effect of one motivation variable on ELS (or vice versa) changes depending on another factor (e.g., interaction of perceived difficulty × environmental attitude). The GAM (generalized additive model) approach checks for non-linear relationships. Results so far suggest some modest curvatures but are not strongly highlighting a major non-linearity (based on the partial deviance explained). Most Useful Analyses for Your Goals Correlations + Factor Analysis These confirm that knowledge and motivation measures cluster into distinct but correlated dimensions. They also reveal whether certain items from separate instruments overlap more than expected. Regressions Linking Knowledge & Motivation Linear models (and potential moderation/mediation) clarify how knowledge predicts or relates to motivation outcomes: for instance, whether a higher ELS score is associated with stronger environmental attitudes. Cluster Analysis to Identify Subgroups K-means or hierarchical clustering with both knowledge and motivation variables is particularly useful for discovering distinct “profiles.” This approach aligns directly with your interest in grouping participants by patterns of knowledge–motivation. Inspecting cluster centers and cluster-specific means on each subscale reveals the different profiles and can guide subsequent targeted interventions or interpretations (e.g., “Cluster A is high-knowledge but low motivation,” etc.). Suggestions for Additional Informative Analyses Below are some optional but potentially valuable additions:\nProfile Comparison on External Variables If you have other outcomes (e.g., actual engagement in environmental behaviors, demographics, or political orientation beyond conservatism alone), compare them across the knowledge–motivation clusters. For example:\nOkay, let’s break down the analyses, highlight the most informative ones, and add some enhancements.\nAssessment of Current Analyses\nThe analyses performed provide a comprehensive exploration of the relationships between the survey instruments, particularly focusing on knowledge and motivation. Here’s a summary:\nStrengths:\nMulti-faceted Approach: The code employs a wide range of techniques:\nCorrelation Analysis: Examining pairwise relationships between variables.\nFactor Analysis (EFA): Exploring underlying latent factors among the subscales.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing dimensionality and visualizing data in a lower-dimensional space.\nRegression Modeling: Predicting knowledge scores from motivation and vice-versa, as well as testing for interactions.\nCluster Analysis (K-means): Identifying groups of individuals with similar response patterns.\nGeneralized Additive Models (GAMs): Investigating potential non-linear relationships.\nStructural Equation Modeling (SEM): Testing a hypothesized measurement and structural model.\nLatent Profile Analysis (LPA): Another approach to clustering that accounts for the probabilistic nature of group membership.\nVisualization: The use of corrplot, ggplot2, and fviz_cluster helps visualize the relationships and cluster structures, making the results more accessible.\nComposite Scores: Creating composite knowledge and motivation scores is a good practice for reducing dimensionality and potentially increasing reliability.\nModel Comparison: The code starts to compare different clustering solutions and regression models, which is crucial for finding the best-fitting and most interpretable models.\nWeaknesses and Areas for Improvement:\nRedundancy: Some analyses are repeated across different code blocks without clear justification. This can be streamlined.\nInterpretation: While the code produces a lot of output, there’s a lack of in-depth interpretation of the findings. More discussion is needed to connect the results back to the research questions.\nJustification of Choices: The number of factors in EFA, the number of clusters in K-means, and the specific variables included in some models could be better justified. Using techniques like scree plots, parallel analysis, the elbow method, and silhouette analysis should be more explicitly demonstrated.\nModel Evaluation: For the regression models, more attention could be paid to model diagnostics (e.g., checking for normality of residuals, homoscedasticity) and model fit statistics.\nCluster Validation: While some initial cluster validation is performed (e.g., comparing clusters on external variables), more robust methods like bootstrap resampling could be used to assess cluster stability.\nOutput Formatting: The output could be more organized and easier to read. Using packages like knitr, kableExtra, or gt for generating tables would be beneficial.\nMost Informative Analyses:\nBased on the stated goals, the following analyses are most informative:\nCorrelation Analysis (with Visualization): The correlation matrix (especially when visualized with corrplot) provides an initial overview of the relationships between all key variables. It helps to quickly see which knowledge and motivation measures are strongly associated.\nFactor Analysis (EFA): This analysis is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of the subscales. It helps determine whether knowledge and motivation are indeed distinct factors or if they load onto a single factor. The results suggest two or three factors, which is consistent with the theoretical framework.\nRegression Models Predicting Knowledge from Motivation (and vice versa): These models directly address the research question about the relationship between knowledge and motivation. The significant coefficients provide evidence for the strength and direction of these relationships.\nCluster Analysis (K-means and LPA): Clustering helps identify distinct groups of individuals based on their knowledge and motivation profiles. K-means provides a simpler, more intuitive approach, while LPA offers a more statistically rigorous method that accounts for measurement error. The analyses suggest there are identifiable groups with differing levels of knowledge and motivation.\nAssessment of Existing Methods\nData Loading and Preprocessing (Page 1)\nAppropriateness: This section is essential and well-executed. It loads necessary packages, sets options, sources functions, and reads in the raw survey data. The creation of combined datasets (e.g., aes_combined, att2_combined) is logical for further analysis.\nConcerns: None.\nCluster Analysis (Pages 2-3, 17-20, 25-27)\nAppropriateness: Cluster analysis is a valid approach to identify groups of subjects with similar response patterns. The use of the elbow method (fviz_nbclust) to determine the optimal number of clusters is standard practice. K-means clustering is a common and generally effective algorithm for this purpose.\nConcerns:\nScaling: The code scales the data before clustering, which is crucial for k-means, as it’s sensitive to variable scales.\nCluster Number: The elbow method often suggests a range rather than a single definitive number. The choice of 3 clusters seems reasonable based on the plots, but exploring 2, 4, or even 5 clusters might offer further insights.\nInterpretation: The interpretation of clusters should be cautious and data-driven. For instance, on page 27 “composite_motivation” seems to be mainly driven by the “perceived_difficulty” component, which might not capture the full picture of motivation.\nVisualization: The cluster visualizations are helpful, but adding confidence ellipses or convex hulls could enhance them.\nAlternative Algorithms: Exploring other clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering (pages 20-21) or model-based clustering (pages 34, 38), might be beneficial.\nFactor Analysis (Pages 4, 45-47)\nAppropriateness: Factor analysis is suitable for exploring the underlying structure of the survey instruments and identifying latent factors that explain the correlations between items. The use of fa function with varimax rotation is standard.\nConcerns:\nNumber of Factors: The scree plot (page 4) suggests two or three factors, but the analysis proceeds with two. Exploring a three-factor solution might reveal a more nuanced structure. On page 45, 5 factors are used, which might be too many given the number of items, potentially leading to overfitting. It’s good that this is noted in a comment, though.\nItem Loadings: Some items have low loadings on all factors, indicating they might not be well-explained by the identified factors.\nInterpretation: Factor interpretation should be based on the items with high loadings on each factor. The provided interpretation seems reasonable.\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA): Given that there are likely some hypotheses about the structure of the instruments, CFA (using lavaan as started on page 47) would be a more appropriate method to test these hypotheses.\nEnhanced Regression Models (Page 5-6)\nAppropriateness: Regression models are useful for predicting one variable from others. The enhanced models on pages 5 and 6 explore the relationships between els_score (energy literacy) and other variables, including interaction terms.\nConcerns:\nMulticollinearity: Including highly correlated predictors (e.g., energy_use and energy_save) can lead to unstable coefficient estimates.\nOverfitting: The models might be overfitting the data, especially with many predictors and interaction terms. Regularization techniques (e.g., LASSO or Ridge regression) could be considered.\nCausal Inference: The code uses causal language (“controlling for”), but these are observational data, and causal claims cannot be made without further assumptions and potentially different methods.\nInteraction Effects in Regression (Pages 6-7)\nAppropriateness: Examining interaction effects is important to understand how the relationship between two variables might change depending on the level of a third variable.\nConcerns: The visualization of the interaction on page 7 is helpful. However, the interpretation should be based on the statistical significance of the interaction term in the regression model.\nEnhanced Correlation Plot (Pages 8-9)\nAppropriateness: Correlation plots are excellent for visualizing the relationships between multiple variables. The use of corrplot is appropriate.\nConcerns: None. This is a well-executed and informative visualization.\nKnowledge Profile Clustering (Pages 10-11, 28)\nAppropriateness: Clustering based on knowledge-related variables is a good way to identify groups with different knowledge profiles.\nConcerns: The interpretation of these clusters should be data-driven and based on the mean scores of the variables within each cluster.\nNon-linear GAM Analysis (Pages 11-12, 14-15)\nAppropriateness: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are suitable for exploring non-linear relationships between variables. The code correctly uses gam function with smoothing terms.\nConcerns:\nOverfitting: GAMs can overfit if the smoothing terms are too flexible. Model selection techniques (e.g., cross-validation) should be used to choose appropriate smoothing parameters.\nInterpretation: The plots on pages 14 are helpful for visualizing the non-linear relationships. The interpretation should be based on the shape of the smoothed curves and the statistical significance of the smooth terms.\nKnowledge-Motivation Interaction Analysis (Pages 12-13)\nAppropriateness: This analysis aims to explore how the relationship between knowledge and motivation might vary across individuals.\nConcerns: The code uses a linear model with an interaction term. However, a more flexible approach, such as a GAM with an interaction term, might be more appropriate to capture non-linear interactions.\nCluster Profile Analysis (Page 16)\nAppropriateness: Comparing cluster profiles based on mean scores of relevant variables is a standard and informative way to understand the characteristics of each cluster.\nConcerns: None.\nStructural Equation Model (Pages 31-33, 36-37, 42-44, 47-49)\nAppropriateness: SEM is a powerful technique for modeling complex relationships between observed and latent variables. It’s particularly useful for testing hypothesized models of how different constructs relate to each other. Given the goals of the study, SEM is a very appropriate method.\nConcerns:\nModel Specification: The specified model on page 31 seems reasonable as a starting point. However, it should be refined based on theoretical considerations and model fit statistics.\nModel Fit: The model fit statistics on pages 32, 37, 43, and 48 suggest that the initial models do not fit the data very well. Model modification should be considered, guided by modification indices and theoretical considerations.\nSample Size: SEM typically requires a large sample size. The sample size of 586 is decent but might be insufficient for complex models.\nMissing Data: The code uses FIML to handle missing data, which is a good approach.\nClassification Tree (Pages 33-34)\nAppropriateness: Classification trees can be useful for identifying subgroups based on a set of predictors.\nConcerns:\nOverfitting: Trees can easily overfit, especially with many predictors. Pruning or using ensemble methods (e.g., random forests) might be necessary.\nInterpretability: While trees are generally interpretable, complex trees can be difficult to understand.\nLatent Profile Analysis (Pages 34-35, 38-41, 50)\nAppropriateness: LPA is a model-based clustering technique that can identify latent subgroups based on continuous variables. It’s a good alternative to k-means, especially when the clusters are not well-separated or have different shapes.\nConcerns:\nModel Selection: The BIC plot on page 35 suggests that the optimal number of classes is not clear-cut. Exploring different numbers of classes and examining the interpretability of the results is important.\nInterpretation: The interpretation of the latent profiles should be based on the mean scores of the variables within each profile.\nCluster Stability Assessment (Pages 51-54)\nAppropriateness: Assessing cluster stability is important to ensure that the identified clusters are not simply due to random chance or the specific algorithm used. The use of clusterboot is appropriate.\nConcerns: None."

    "text": "Code\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting Information\nAttari, S. Z. (2014). Perceptions of water use. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111(14), 5129–5134. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1316402111\n\nData Sources and Values of Actual Water Use\nThe estimation process and the data sources for actual water use for the 17 activities are detailed below. The data reflect the best available information at the time of analysis. Estimation for actual water use for all of the end-uses and activities shown in Fig. 3:\n\nFlushing a low-flow toilet one time: as per the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (1), the current federal standard for low-flow or efficient toilets is 1.6 gallons per flush or less, even though there are models that currently exist that both provide superior performance and use less water that are rated as WaterSense toilets that operate at 1.28 gallons per flush (1).\nFlushing a standard-flow toilet one time: Mayer et al. (ref. 2, p. 96) found that for the majority of the 348,345 toilet flushes recorded in their 12 sites, the range for water use fell into 3-5 gallons per flush, with 3.5 gallons per flush dominating. Another source from the EPA confirms that pre-retrofit, the average flush volume is 3.68 gallons per flush (3, p. 37), which is an average from three study sites. The Mayer et al. (2) estimate was used as the actual value because it covered 12 study sites.\nWashing one load of dishes with a high-efficiency home dishwasher: efficient dishwashers are rated at less than or equal to 4.25 gallons per load by the Department of Energy (4).\nA leaking faucet (1 drip per 1 s) for 1 d (24 h): this was calculated and verified; 1 drip per s produces 60 drips per min. Multiplied by 1,440 min/d gives 86,400 drips total. One gallon has 15,140 drips as per the US Geological Survey (5), giving 5.7 gallons per d.\nWashing one load of dishes with a standard home dishwasher: in their water trivia facts, the EPA estimates that the average dishwasher uses between 9 and 12 gallons of water per load. The arithmetic average of 10.5 gallons per load was used as the actual number.\nRunning a high-efficiency bathroom faucet for 10 min at its maximum flow rate: The EPA WaterSense specification for low-flow/high-efficiency faucets is set at a maximum of 1.5 gallons per min (6). Therefore, 10 min at the maximum flow rate is 15 gallons of water.\nUsing a high-efficiency, front-loading home washer for one load of laundry: as per the Energy Star Department of Energy rating, “a full-sized Energy Star certified clothes washer uses 15 gallons of water per load” (7).\nTaking a low-flow shower for 10 min at its maximum flow rate: EPA WaterSense standards for low-flow showerheads must use no more than 2 gallons per min (8), giving 20 gallons of water for a 10-min shower.\nRunning a standard bathroom faucet for 10 min at its maximum flow rate: the EPA specification for standard faucets is 2.2 gallons per min (6), giving 22 gallons of water for 10 min.\nTaking a standard-flow shower for 10 min at its maximum flow rate: EPA-regulated standard showerheads use 2.5 gallons per min (8), giving 25 gallons of water for a 10-min shower.\nFilling one typical bathtub: as per the California Energy Commission, an average bath requires 30-50 gallons of water (9). An arithmetic mean on the range gives about 40 gallons of water.\nUsing a standard, top-loading home washer for one load of laundry: as per the California Energy Commission, older top-loading machines use about 40 gallons of water to wash a full load of clothes although newer standard models use about 27 gallons of water (10). An arithmetic mean on the range gives about 34 gallons of water per load.\nWashing a car at a drive-in, conveyor automatic car wash: a report prepared for the water utilities in El Paso, TX stated that in-bay automatic carwashes use about 50–60 gallons per vehicle (11). The arithmetic average of 55 gallons per vehicle was used.\nWatering a lawn with a garden hose at its maximum flow rate for 10 min: the volume of water used from a garden hose was determined based on hose size (5/8 inch), hose supply pressure (40 psi), and hose length (100 feet) will have a flow rate of 11 gallons per min, leading to 110 gallons of water for 10 min (12).\nFilling one hot tub (“Jacuzzi”) (six-person capacity): there is no standard hot tub dimension that fits six people. To estimate this activity’s water use, many sources were found online via retail stores selling the product and water-use specifications were averaged providing an estimate of 405 gallons of water. These estimates were from 260 gallons (13) to about 550 gallons (14).\nFilling one typical backyard in-ground pool (5 × 15 × 30 feet): these dimensions give a volume of 2250 cubic feet or 16,831 gallons of water.\nFilling one Olympic-sized competition swimming pool: the dimensions of an Olympic-sized pool are 50 × 25 × 2 m (15), giving 2,500 m³ or about 660,000 gallons of water.\n\n\n\nData Sources and Values of Embodied Water Use\nThe data sources for embodied water content (alternatively “water footprint”) were used from the Waterfootprint.org website. They state that the “Water Footprint of a product is the volume of freshwater appropriated to produce the product, taking into account the volumes of water consumed and polluted in the different steps of the supply chain.”\n\nOne pound of sugar: it takes about 1,782 L of water to produce 1 kg of sugar from sugar cane and about 920 L of water to produce 1 kg of sugar from sugar beets (16). In the United States, which is the world’s largest sugar producer, sugarcane accounts for about 45% of the total sugar produced domestically, and sugar beets for about 55% of production (17). Thus, the weighted average is (0.45 × 1782) + (0.55 × 920) = 1,308 L of water to produce 1 kg of sugar or about 157 gallons of water per pound of sugar.\nOne pound of rice: it takes about 2,497 L of water to produce 1 kg of rice (16, 18) or about 299 gallons of water per pound of rice.\nOne pound of cheese: it takes about 5,060 L of water to produce 1 kg of cheese (16, 19) or about 606 gallons of water per pound of cheese.\nOne pound of coffee: it takes about 18,900 L of water to produce 1 kg of roasted coffee (16) or about 2,264 gallons of water per pound of coffee.\n\n\n\nOrder Effects of First Two Open-Ended Questions\nTo explore order effects, Fig. 2 can be divided into two 3 x 3 tables (self/American vs. American/self), with the following categories: curtailment, efficiency, and other. Fig. S1 shows the relative joint percentage distribution of responses for self and for Americans using these three categories. Fig. S1 also displays a marginally significant asymmetry as highlighted by the arrows, indicating that participants are somewhat more likely to recommend curtailment actions for themselves and efficiency actions for others than vice versa. Note that the two tables are fairly similar and the hypothesis of identical joint distributions cannot quite be rejected: χ² = 13.63 (likelihood-ratio test, 8 df).\nFig. S1. Joint distributions (percentages) of endorsement categories for self and for Americans from the first two open-ended questions by order. Tests of the asymmetry in response shifts from self to Americans, indicated by the arrows, are given as estimated log odds with estimated SEs.\n(Table representing Fig S1 data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericans (Order: Self/Americans N=515)\n\n\nAmericans (Order: Americans/Self N=505)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurtailment\nEfficiency\nOther\nCurtailment\nEfficiency\nOther\n\n\nSelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurtailment\n55.2\n8.4\n11.5\n60.8\n6.7\n9.1\n\n\nEfficiency\n4.9\n2.7\n2.7\n3.2\n4.2\n1.8\n\n\nOther\n4.3\n1.4\n9.1\n6.5\n1.6\n6.1\n\n\nDiagonal asymmetry\nloge(8.4/4.9) = 0.54 ± 0.37\n\n\nloge(6.7/3.2) = 0.74 ± 0.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultilevel Regression Results\nTo investigate individual differences in accuracy, 10 centered individual difference variables [e.g., numeracy, proenvironmental attitudes as measured by the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale, age] were added as predictors in the multilevel regression model. The result of the extended model (using all 10 centered individual difference variables) appears in the Table S1, and is not appreciably different from the simple model presented in the current paper.\nTable S1.

They use a large battery pack to store electricity and power the electric motor. Hybrid vehicles are not considered electric vehicles for the purposes of this survey.\n\n\nHeat Pumps are an electric alternative to furnaces and air conditioners. Heat pumps transfer heat rather than generating heat by burning fuel. During the winter, heat pumps warm your home by moving heat from outdoors to indoors. During the summer, heat pumps cool by moving heat from your house outdoors."

    "text": "Phase 2: Modified Dictator Game (Based on Fig A.7 - A.14 & Text)\nInstructions (Low Externality Example - Fig A.7):\nIn Phase 2, you will make a purchase decision for multiple rounds. In each round, you own 100 initial points. You will decide how to allocate the points to purchasing the experimental product. Every unit of purchasing costs 1 point (unit cost = 1 point), and brings 2 points of benefit (unit benefit = 2 points). Your payoff of a round will be: payoff = initial points - unit cost * purchase amount + unit benefit * purchase amount = 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount\nApart from the points, there will be carbon offsets for the amount of 100 kg CO2 (= carbon dioxide, or in short: carbon) at the beginning of each round (initial carbon offsets = 100 kg). Purchasing every unit of the experimental product causes 0.5 kg carbon emissions from its production, which will reduce the initial stock of 100 kg carbon offsets by 0.5 kg (unit emissions = 0.5 kg). At the end of each round, the carbon offsets that can be contributed will be: carbon offsets contribution = initial carbon offsets - unit emissions * purchase amount = 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount\n(Note: In the High Externality condition, unit emissions = 1 kg)\nCarbon offsets are used to compensate the carbon emissions from human activities: carbon emissions are reduced by contributing money to environmental projects that reduce emissions, such as reforestation and solar energy generation. The picture visualises the principle of a carbon offset: [Visual of CO2 offsetting principle]\nAt the end of this phase, one round will be randomly selected for payment. Your decision in that round will determine your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution of Phase 2. At the end of the experiment, your payoff will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1 and will be paid via Prolific. The carbon offsets will be donated to a real-world project via Gold Standard. More information about the Gold Standard-certified projects will be available at the end of this experiment. If you are still unclear about the task, do not worry. The instructions are available throughout this phase. On the next page, you will see an example on how your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution are determined in a round. Then you will be asked to answer two questions to help comprehension.\nExample Calculation Page (Low Externality - Fig A.8):\nFor example, if you decide to purchase 0/50/100 unit(s) of the experimental product in a round: according to: payoff = 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount carbon offsets contribution = 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount results of the example purchases will be: | Purchase amount | Individual payoff | Carbon emissions | Carbon offsets that can be contributed | |—————–|——————-|——————|————————————–| | 0 | 100 points | 0 kg | 100 kg | | 50 | 150 points | 25 kg | 75 kg | | 100 | 200 points | 50 kg | 50 kg |\nComprehension Questions (Low Externality - Fig A.9):\nQ1.

The responses vary on a scale of agreement / disagreement, from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree:. For example:\nStatement: Doing research in a library has been made easier by the introduction of computerized card cataloguing systems.\n[ ] Strongly agree [ ] Agree [ ] Undecided [ ] Disagree [ ] Strongly disagree\nGive your answer for each statement and be sure to place your response in the correct place. Remember, this is an opinion survey and not a test of intelligence or ability. There are no right or wrong answers, only answer that fit your views accurately. Do not skip any question. Time is limited. Do you have any questions?\n(Rating Scale: Strongly agree, Agree, Undecided, Disagree, Strongly disagree)\n\n\nStatements\n\nManually sorting through card catalogues is more reliable than computer-aided searches for finding items in a library.\nIf I need to have a tumour in my body removed, I would choose to undergo computer-aided surgery using laser technology because computerized surgery is more reliable and safer than manual surgery.\nPeople save time by using automatic teller machines (ATMs) rather than a bank teller for banking transactions.\nI do not trust automated devices such as ATMs and computerized airline reservation systems.\nPeople who work frequently with automated devices have lower job satisfaction because they feel less involved in their job than those who work manually.\nI feel safer depositing my money at ATM than with a human teller.\nI have to tape an important TV program for a class assignment. To ensure that the correct program is recorded, I would use the automatic programming facility on my VCR rather than manually taping.\nPeople whose job requires them to work with automated systems are lonelier than people who do not have work with such devices.\nAutomated systems used in modern aircraft, such as the automatic landing system, have made air journeys safer.\nATMs provide a safeguard against the inappropriate use of an individual’s bank account by dishonest people.\nAutomated devices used in aviation and banking have made work easier for both employees and customers.\nI often use automated devices.\nPeople who work with automated devices have greater job satisfaction because they feel more involved than those who work manually.\nAutomated devices in medicine save time and money in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.\nEven though the automatic cruise control in my car is set at a speed below the speed limit, I worry when I pass a police radar speed-trap in case the automatic control is not working properly.\nBank transactions have become safer with the introduction of computer technology for the transfer of funds.\nI would rather purchase an item using a computer than have to deal with a sale representative on the phone because my order is more likely to be correct using the computer.\nWork has become more difficult with the increase of automation in aviation and banking.\nI do not like to use ATMs because I feel that they are sometimes unreliable.\nI think that automated devices used in medicine, such as CAT-scans and ultrasound, provide very reliable medical diagnosis."

    "text": "A. Survey Instruments\n\nDefinition\n\nWe would like to know your opinion on artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence refers to technical devices that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It enables machines to sense, act, and adapt autonomously. Artificial intelligence can be part of a computer program or an online application, but can also be found in various machines such as robots. It can be used in the workplace, in medicine and nursing as well as in education and training.\n\n\n\nInstruction\n\nPlease indicate your level of agreement for each statement. There are no correct or incorrect answers.\n\n\n\nItems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain\nFacet\nItem\n\n\n\n\nWork\nCognitive\nArtificial intelligence offers good solutions for many job tasks.\n\n\nWork\nAffective\nI have a good feeling when I think about the use of artificial intelligence in daily working life.\n\n\nWork\nBehavioral\nIf I have to complete an important task at work, I would rather choose a technology with artificial intelligence than one without.\n\n\nHealthcare\nCognitive\nArtificial intelligence offers good solutions in medicine and nursing.\n\n\nHealthcare\nAffective\nI have a good feeling when I think about how artificial intelligence is being used in healthcare and nursing.\n\n\nHealthcare\nBehavioral\nFor the treatment of a serious illness, I would rather choose a technology with artificial intelligence than one without.\n\n\nEducation\nCognitive\nArtificial intelligence is helpful for learning and teaching.\n\n\nEducation\nAffective\nI have positive feelings when I think about how artificial intelligence is used in education and training.\n\n\nEducation\nBehavioral\nIf I want to learn something new, I would choose a learning program with artificial intelligence rather than one without.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse format\n\n0 = strongly disagree\n1 = disagree\n2 = neither\n3 = agree\n4 = strongly agree\n-1 = cannot or do not want to answer\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence Experience and Attitude Survey (AIEASM, Gnambs, Griese et al., 2025)\n\nDescription of AI scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Type\nWorkplace\nHealthcare\nEducation\n\n\n\n\nVirtual assistants\nAutomated helpdesks are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to address common questions from employees. These programs can be used by companies or public institutions as a point of contact and advice. If employees have questions about products or technical problems, they are answered automatically by email or chat without human intervention.\nMedical chatbots are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions about ailments and symptoms of illness. Patients can communicate with the chatbot verbally or via written text entries. When they ask questions about their state of health, they are automatically answered without human intervention.\nVirtual assistants are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions from learners about specific knowledge areas. The dialogue takes place either verbally or via written text. When learners pose questions, they are answered automatically without human intervention.\n\n\nRecommender systems\nArtificial intelligence is used to make suggestions at the workplace as to which tasks need to be completed next and which solutions or work steps are suitable.\nHealth apps are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to analyze physical activity, sleep patterns, and dietary habits. They provide personalized recommendations for a healthy lifestyle such as fitness or nutrition plans.\nLearning software uses artificial intelligence to analyze the learning progress of users. It provides personalized recommendations for learning content that has not yet been fully consolidated or for additional topics.\n\n\nRobots\nIndustrial robots with artificial intelligence are machines that can independently manufacture new products on the assembly line with little supervision by human operators.\nCare robots with artificial intelligence perform physical tasks in hospitals or nursing homes. They help patients with limited mobility to get out of bed, pick up objects, wash themselves, or get dressed.\nSocial Robots with artificial intelligence are machines for interacting with people. They can help learners largely independently and individually, for example by participating in interactive learning or helping with language acquisition.\n\n\nPredictive analytics\nArtificial intelligence can analyze job applications to identify suitable candidates. For this, it uses information from application documents or behavior in the interview. This helps organizations to predict the likely professional success of a candidate.\nArtificial intelligence can use medical scans (images) or information about a patient’s lifestyle to predict the risk of certain types of cancer or mental illnesses. This can aid in the development of personalized prevention or treatment plans.\nArtificial intelligence can analyze information about participants in a training or further education course to predict which individuals are at risk of performing poorly or dropping out of the course. An early warning system like this can help to identify people at risk and provide the necessary support.\n\n\nMonitoring\nArtificial intelligence can automatically monitor the productivity of employees and, for example, analyse computer usage or production and sales figures. This helps companies to optimize work processes and identify employees who need additional support.\nArtificial intelligence can monitor various vital signs such as heart rate or blood pressure. Electronic devices that are worn on the body inform in real-time, for example, about the wearer’s health and fitness or potential illnesses.\nComputer programs with artificial intelligence can analyze texts from students or participants in training or further education courses to identify plagiarism, that is, text parts written by others.\n\n\nContent generation\nArtificial intelligence can create new and unique content such as texts, illustrations, or photos. It is used, for example, in marketing to develop catchy slogans for ads, design brand logos, or create fictional advertising photos.\nArtificial intelligence can analyze medical information about patients to automatically create health reports, doctor’s letters, diagnoses, and treatment plans.\nArtificial intelligence can analyze large amounts of text from textbooks or articles and briefly summarize the most important information.

These programs can be used by companies or public institutions as a point of contact and advice. If employees have questions about products or technical problems, they are answered automatically by email or chat without human intervention. | Medical chatbots are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions about ailments and symptoms of illness. Patients can communicate with the chatbot verbally or via written text entries. When they ask questions about their state of health, they are automatically answered without human intervention. | Virtual assistants are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions from learners about specific knowledge areas. The dialogue takes place either verbally or via written text. When learners pose questions, they are answered automatically without human intervention. |\n| **Recommender systems** | Artificial intelligence is used to make suggestions at the workplace as to which tasks need to be completed next and which solutions or work steps are suitable.                                                                                                  | Health apps are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to analyze physical activity, sleep patterns, and dietary habits. They provide personalized recommendations for a healthy lifestyle such as fitness or nutrition plans.      | Learning software uses artificial intelligence to analyze the learning progress of users. It provides personalized recommendations for learning content that has not yet been fully consolidated or for additional topics.             |\n| **Robots**              | Industrial robots with artificial intelligence are machines that can independently manufacture new products on the assembly line with little supervision by human operators.                                                                                   | Care robots with artificial intelligence perform physical tasks in hospitals or nursing homes. They help patients with limited mobility to get out of bed, pick up objects, wash themselves, or get dressed.                               | Social Robots with artificial intelligence are machines for interacting with people. They can help learners largely independently and individually, for example by participating in interactive learning or helping with language acquisition. |\n| **Predictive analytics** | Artificial intelligence can analyze job applications to identify suitable candidates. For this, it uses information from application documents or behavior in the interview. This helps organizations to predict the likely professional success of a candidate. | Artificial intelligence can use medical scans (images) or information about a patient's lifestyle to predict the risk of certain types of cancer or mental illnesses. This can aid in the development of personalized prevention or treatment plans. | Artificial intelligence can analyze information about participants in a training or further education course to predict which individuals are at risk of performing poorly or dropping out of the course. An early warning system like this can help to identify people at risk and provide the necessary support. |\n| **Monitoring**          | Artificial intelligence can automatically monitor the productivity of employees and, for example, analyse computer usage or production and sales figures. This helps companies to optimize work processes and identify employees who need additional support.       | Artificial intelligence can monitor various vital signs such as heart rate or blood pressure. Electronic devices that are worn on the body inform in real-time, for example, about the wearer's health and fitness or potential illnesses. | Computer programs with artificial intelligence can analyze texts from students or participants in training or further education courses to identify plagiarism, that is, text parts written by others.                            |\n| **Content generation**  | Artificial intelligence can create new and unique content such as texts, illustrations, or photos. It is used, for example, in marketing to develop catchy slogans for ads, design brand logos, or create fictional advertising photos.                         | Artificial intelligence can analyze medical information about patients to automatically create health reports, doctor's letters, diagnoses, and treatment plans.                                                                            | Artificial intelligence can analyze large amounts of text from textbooks or articles and briefly summarize the most important information. This provides learners with a quick and concise overview of complicated topics.           |\n\n#### Items for each AI scenario\n\n1.

A web-based service (such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc.) identifies the phone’s coordinates along with the desired destination entered by the phone user. This information is transmitted to a computer, where The Map Service calculates the best route based on shortest path, but also traffic and other variables. The instructions are then sent back to the phone. The Map Service monitors the phone’s location in real-time, and each step is given to the user based on the phone’s proximity to the next step (or checkpoint).\n\nExplanation Judged a priori to be Relatively “Bad”\n\nCell phones can provide good directions because they have really accurate maps on them. The phone downloads the maps from the internet. The phone knows where it is and it calculates the shortest route. It tries to give step-by-step directions.\n\n\n\nHow does automobile cruise control work?\nExplanation Judged a priori to be Relatively “Good”\n\nThe speed of the car at the moment you turn on the cruise control is stored in a memory circuit. The cruise control device reads the car’s speed by a speed sensor that is on the car’s drive shaft. The cruise control is linked to the engine accelerator, and accelerates the car when it falls below the speed you set, such as when you start to go uphill, for example. It can stop accelerating the car when the car is going downhill, but does not apply the brakes to decelerate the car. The cruise control also senses when the brake pedal has been depressed, and disengages from the accelerator.\n\nExplanation Judged a priori to be Relatively “Bad”\n\nThe vacuum control unit reads the pulse frequency from a magnet mounted on the drive shaft to figure out how fast the car is going. A bidirectional screw-drive electric motor that is connected to the accelerator linkage receives the control signal and transmits it to the throttle. When you set the cruise control, the engine detects the engine RPM at that point and tries to maintain that engine speed until it is disengaged. The cruise control detects the car gear, which it adjusts to allow the engine to maintain a constant RPM.\n\n\n\nHow do computers predict hurricanes?\nExplanation Judged a priori to be Relatively “Good”\n\nComputers have a mathematical model of the atmosphere that divides the world into many small regions, each just a few square kilometers. Each region is defined in terms of its air pressure, temperature, winds, and moisture. The computer calculates what will happen at the boundaries of each region. For example, strong winds in one region will move air into an adjacent region. These calculations must be performed for every boundary between all the regions. This allows the prediction of the path a hurricane will take.\n\nExplanation Judged a priori to be Relatively “Bad”\n\nThe computers have a database of all previous hurricanes and the paths that they followed. Once a hurricane is located, using a satellite image, the computer accesses the database and determines the path that was most frequently taken by hurricanes having that initial location. This process is repeated once every hour, tracking the hurricane as it moves. The computers can also tell when the winds and rain will impact the land, and that is when the hurricane warnings are issued.\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix C: Explanation Satisfaction Scale (pp. 39-40)\n\nFrom the explanation, I understand how the [software, algorithm, tool] works. | 5 I agree strongly | 4 I agree somewhat | 3 I’m neutral about it | 2 I disagree somewhat | 1 I disagree strongly | | :—————-: | :—————-: | :——————–: | :——————-: | :——————-: | | | | | | |\nThis explanation of how the [software, algorithm, tool] works is satisfying. | 5 I agree strongly | 4 I agree somewhat | 3 I’m neutral about it | 2 I disagree somewhat | 1 I disagree strongly | | :—————-: | :—————-: | :——————–: | :——————-: | :——————-: | | | | | | |\nThis explanation of how the [software, algorithm, tool] works has sufficient detail. | 5 I agree strongly | 4 I agree somewhat | 3 I’m neutral about it | 2 I disagree somewhat | 1 I disagree strongly | | :—————-: | :—————-: | :——————–: | :——————-: | :——————-: | | | | | | |\nThis explanation of how the [software, algorithm, tool] works seems complete. | 5 I agree strongly | 4 I agree somewhat | 3 I’m neutral about it | 2 I disagree somewhat | 1 I disagree strongly | | :—————-: | :—————-: | :——————–: | :——————-: | :——————-: | | | | | | |\nThis explanation of how the [software, algorithm, tool] works tells me how to use it. | 5 I agree strongly | 4 I agree somewhat | 3 I’m neutral about it | 2 I disagree somewhat | 1 I disagree strongly | | :—————-: | :—————-: | :——————–: | :——————-: | :——————-: | | | | | | |\nThis explanation of how the [software, algorithm, tool] works is useful to my goals. | 5 I agree strongly | 4 I agree somewhat | 3 I’m neutral about it | 2 I disagree somewhat | 1 I disagree strongly | | :—————-: | :—————-: | :——————–: | :——————-: | :——————-: | | | | | | |\nThis explanation of the [software, algorithm, tool] shows me how accurate the [software, algorithm, tool] is. | 5 I agree strongly | 4 I agree somewhat | 3 I’m neutral about it | 2 I disagree somewhat | 1 I disagree strongly | | :—————-: | :—————-: | :——————–: | :——————-: | :——————-: | | | | | | |\nThis explanation lets me judge when I should trust and not trust the [software, algorithm, tool]. | 5 I agree strongly | 4 I agree somewhat | 3 I’m neutral about it | 2 I disagree somewhat | 1 I disagree strongly | | :—————-: | :—————-: | :——————–: | :——————-: | :——————-: | | | | | | |\n\n\n\n\nAppendix D: Synopsis of Representative Trust Scales (pp. 41-48)\n\nCahour-Forzy (2009) Scale; Adams, et al. (2003) Scale\n\nDefined trust (and distrust) as a sentiment resulting from knowledge, beliefs, emotions and other aspects of experience, generating positive or negative expectations concerning the reactions of a system and the interaction with it. Developed for learning to use a cruise control system. Factors: reliability, predictability, efficiency. Assumes considerable experience. Original scale was bipolar “I agree completely” to “I do not agree at all.” Items below modified to fit a 7-point Likert form.\n\n\nWhat is your confidence in the [tool]? Do you have a feeling of trust in it? | 1 I do not trust it at all | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 I trust it completely | | :———————– | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :———————: | | | | | | | | |\nAre the actions of the [tool] predictable? | 1 It is not at all predictable | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 It is completely predictable | | :—————————– | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :————————— | | | | | | | | |\nIs the [tool] reliable?

Factors: Fidelity, loyalty, reliability, security, integrity, familiarity. Widely used. (Note: Item 4 is noted as particularly interesting; ‘integrity’ item is considered problematic; ‘familiarity’ may not be relevant if user experience is known).\n\n\nThe system is deceptive.\nThe system behaves in an underhanded manner.\nI am suspicious of the system’s intent, action, or outputs.\nI am wary of the system.\nThe system’s actions will have a harmful or injurious outcome.\nI am confident in the system.\nThe system provides security.\nThe system has integrity.\nThe system is dependable.\nI can trust the system.\nI am familiar with the system.\n\n\n\nMadsen-Gregor Scale (2000)\n\nDefines trust as both affective and cognitive. Factors: reliability, technical competence, understandability, faith, personal attachment. Focused on intelligent decision aids. (Note: Original response format not specified, possibly Likert. High reliability reported. ‘Understandability’ and ‘competence’ factors relate to mental models. ‘Faith’ factor relates to reliance/uncertainty. ‘Personal attachment’ factor relates to liking.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nItem\n\n\n\n\nPerceived Reliability\nThe system always provides the advice I require to make my decision.\n\n\n\nThe system performs reliably.\n\n\n\nThe system responds the same way under the same conditions at different times.\n\n\n\nI can rely on the system to function properly.\n\n\nPerceived Technical Competence\nThe system analyzes problems consistently.\n\n\n\nThe system uses appropriate methods to reach decisions.\n\n\n\nThe system has sound knowledge about this type of problem built into it.\n\n\n\nThe advice the system produces is as good as that which a highly competent person could produce.\n\n\n\nThe system correctly uses the information I enter.\n\n\n\nThe system makes use of all the knowledge and information available to it to produce its solution to the problem.\n\n\nPerceived Understandability\nI know what will happen the next time I use the system because I understand how it behaves.\n\n\n\nI understand how the system will assist me with decisions I have to make.\n\n\n\nAlthough I may not know exactly how the system works, I know how to use it to make decisions about the problem.\n\n\n\nIt is easy to follow what the system does.\n\n\n\nI recognize what I should do to get the advice I need from the system the next time I use it.\n\n\nFaith\nI believe advice from the system even when I don’t know for certain that it is correct.\n\n\n\nWhen I am uncertain about a decision I believe the system rather than myself.\n\n\n\nIf I am not sure about a decision, I have faith that the system will provide the best solution.\n\n\n\nWhen the system gives unusual advice I am confident that the advice is correct.\n\n\n\nEven if I have no reason to expect the system will be able to solve a difficult problem, I still feel certain that it will.\n\n\nPersonal Attachment\nI would feel a sense of loss if the system was unavailable and I could not longer use it.\n\n\n\nI feel a sense of attachment to using the system.\n\n\n\nI find the system suitable to my style of decision making.\n\n\n\nI like using the system for decision making.\n\n\n\nI have a personal preference for making decisions with the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nMerritt Scale (2011)\n\nRegards trust as an emotional, attitudinal judgement. Factors: belief, confidence, dependability, propensity to trust, liking. Evaluated in a baggage screening task. Items are similar to Cahour-Fourzy.\n\n\nI believe the system is a competent performer.\nI trust the system.\nI have confidence in the advice given by the system.\nI can depend on the system.\nI can rely on the system to behave in consistent ways.\nI can rely on the system to do its best every time I take its advice.\n\n\n\nSchaefer Scale (2013)\n\nDeveloped for human-robot collaboration. Factors: ability, performance. Unique format: estimate the percentage of time the machine would show each behavior. Many items anthropomorphize and may be inappropriate for XAI.\n\nPrompt: What percentage of the time will this machine (robot)…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppropriate Items (potentially adaptable for XAI)\nInappropriate/Anthropomorphic Items\n\n\n\n\nAct consistently\nProtect people\n\n\nFunction successfully\nAct as part of the team\n\n\nHave errors\nMalfunction\n\n\nPerform a task better than a novice human user\nClearly communicate\n\n\nPossess adequate decision-making capability\nRequire frequent maintenance\n\n\nPerform exactly as instructed\nOpenly communicate\n\n\nMake sensible decisions\nKnow the difference between friend and foe\n\n\nTell the truth\nProvide feedback\n\n\nPerform many functions at one time\nWarn people of potential risks in the environment\n\n\nFollow directions\nMeet the needs of the mission\n\n\nIncompetent\nProvide appropriate information\n\n\nDependable\nCommunicate with people\n\n\nReliable\nWork best with a team\n\n\nPredictable\nKeep classified information secure\n\n\n\nWork in close proximity with people\n\n\n\nConsidered part of the team\n\n\n\nFriendly\n\n\n\nPleasant\n\n\n\nUnresponsive\n\n\n\nAutonomous\n\n\n\nConscious\n\n\n\nLifelike\n\n\n\nA good teammate\n\n\n\nLed astray by unexpected changes in the environment\n\n\n\n\n\nSingh, et al. Scale (1993)\n\nPresupposes prior experience (e.g., ATMs). Defines trust as an attitude reflecting potential for complacency. Factors: confidence, reliance, trust, safety, complacency. Merges trust and reliance. Considered not appropriate for initial XAI use. Items overlap with factors in Cahour-Fourzy. (Specific items not fully listed in Appendix D, focuses on factors and context).\nFactor examples: * Factor 1: Confidence (e.g., medical device reliability) * Factor 2: Reliance (e.g., ATM safeguards, automation making work easier) * Factor 3: Trust (e.g., reliability of library searches, safety of bank transactions) * Factor 4: Safety (e.g., safety of depositing at ATM vs teller)\n\n\n\nWang, et al. Scale (2009)\n\nUsed to evaluate trust in a hypothetical “combat identification system”. Items adapted from Jian, et al. Scale. Response format not specified (possibly Likert). Some items context-specific. Noteworthy for explicitly referencing deception and mistrust.\n\n\nThe aid is deceptive.\nThe aid behaves in an underhanded (concealed) manner.\nI am suspicious of the aid’s outputs.\nI am wary of the aid.\nThe aid’s action will have a harmful or injurious outcome.\nI am confident in the aid.\nThe aid provides security.\nThe aid is dependable.\nThe aid is reliable.\nI can trust the aid.\nI am familiar with the aid.\nI can trust that blue lights indicate soldiers. (Context-specific example)\nI can trust that red lights indicate terrorists. (Context-specific example)\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix E: Trust Scale Recommended for XAI (pp. 49-50)\n\nAsks users directly whether they are confident in the XAI system, whether the XAI system is predictable, reliable, efficient, and believable. Assumes considerable experience using the XAI system. Items adapted primarily from Cahour-Fourzy Scale (2009), with item 6 from Jian et al. (2000), item 7 from Schaefer (2013), and item 8 from Madsen-Gregor (2000). Uses a 5-point Likert scale.\n\n\nI am confident in the [tool].

This research is executed in the chair of Social Psychology: Media and Communication, headed by Prof. Dr. Nicole Krämer. This study is executed within the framework of a cooperation of the University of Duisburg-Essen, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund and University Hospital Essen.\nIn this study we want to investigate the influence of different human factors on the reception of advice given by Artificial Intelligence (AI). You will be asked to run through a skin lesion classification task within which you will be aided by an AI. Afterwards you have to complete different questionnaires concerning various personality factors.\nThe survey will approximately take 12 minutes.\nParticipation in the study is voluntary. You can terminate the study at any time and without giving reasons. There are no negative consequences if you terminate participation compared to the study."

You will see a clinical photography of a skin lesion and will be asked to decide whether you would classify the lesion as benign or malign on a scale from 0% (definitely benign) to 100% (definitely malign).\nAfter indicating your estimation and pressing the “Next” button you will be presented with the same image. However, now you will be shown additional advice on diagnosis given by an AI. Please consider this advice to form a second opinion and help you assess your first estimation. The AI was previously trained on a dataset provided by University Skin Cancer Center Tübingen, it reached an accuracy of about 80%. A human expert with similar support can make mistakes in this classification. We are aiming for a high total accuracy through the collaboration of human and AI.\nIf you want to you can adjust your prior estimate. After pressing “Next” again you will be presented with the next lesion image.\n(Note: The actual task involved presenting 24 images, asking for an initial slider rating (0-100), then showing the AI’s slider rating (reported as 80% accurate overall), and allowing the participant to provide a final slider rating. The screenshot shows an example mid-task.)"

As a result, it’s expected that your portfolio’s performance will be under the average in the long run.\n\n\nAI\nWithin the digital echo of your actions, AI sifts through the noise to forecast your next move. It transforms your clicks, likes, and digital whispers into a map of future investment choices. Based on our AI model analysis, you are more likely to make rational investment decisions based on reason rather than emotion. You have a good grasp of your emotions especially when it comes to decisions about money. Therefore, we predict that your portfolio will have higher-than-average performance in the long run.\nWithin the digital echo of your actions, AI sifts through the noise to forecast your next move.

(MJ), & Cho, J. (2025). The Trap of AI Literacy: The Paradoxical Relationships Between College Students’ Use of LLMs, AI Literacy, and Fact-checking Behavior. Proceedings of the Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 1–7. https://doi.org/10.1145/3706599.3719681\n\n\nThis document includes the survey items used to measure the variables examined in the study by Rheu & Cho (2025).\n\n## AI Literacy¹\n\nPlease read the following statements carefully and indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with each statement by selecting the most appropriate response on a scale from 1 to 7.\n\n(1= Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Somewhat disagree, 4 = Neither disagree or agree, 5 = Somewhat agree, 6 = Agree, 7 = Strongly agree)\n\n### Self-Efficacy\n\n1.  I am confident I will perform well on LLM-related tasks.\n2.  I am confident I will do well on LLMs related projects.\n3.  I believe I can master LLMs knowledge and skills.\n4.  I believe I can earn good grades in LLMs related assessments.\n\n### Cognitive Learning\n\n1.  I know what LLM is and its definition.\n2.  I know how to use LLM applications (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).\n3.  I can compare the differences between AI concepts (e.g., deep learning, machine learning).\n4.  I can apply LLM applications to solve problems\n5.  I can create LLM-driven solutions (e.g.,Chatbots) to solve problems.\n6.  I can evaluate LLM applications and concepts to different situations.\n\n---\n\nPlease read the following statements carefully and indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with each statement on a scale from 1 to 7.\n\nI have knowledge of...\n\n### AI Technology Knowledge\n\n1.  The types of technology that LLM is built on\n2.  how LLMs and other AI technologies are distinct.\n3.  Use cases for LLMs.\n4.  The roles that LLMs can have in human-AI interaction.\n\n### AI-Steps Knowledge\n\n1.  The input data requirements for LLMs.\n2.  How input data is perceived by LLMs.\n3.  Potential impacts that input data has on LLMs.\n4.  Which input data types LLMs can use.\n5.  LLMs processing methods and models.\n6.  How information is presented for LLMs processing.\n7.  The risks LLMs processing poses.\n8.  Why LLMs processing can be described as a learning process.\n9.  Using LLMs output and interpreting it.\n10. LLMs output limitations.\n11. How to handle LLMs output.\n12. Which LLMs outputs are obtainable with current methods.\n\n---\n\n¹ AI literacy was measured using four sub-dimensions. The first two sub-dimensions (Self-efficacy and cognitive learning) were from Ng et al. (2024) and the other two dimensions (AI technology knowledge and AI steps knowledge) were from Pinski & Benlian (2023)\n\n## Machine Heuristics\n\nThe following statements describe your perception of the LLMs applications you use, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude. Please read them carefully and indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with each statement on a scale from 1 to 7.\n\n(1= Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Somewhat disagree, 4 = Neither disagree or agree, 5 = Somewhat agree, 6 = Agree, 7 = Strongly agree)\n\nLLMs applications are...\n\n1.  Knowledgeable\n2.  Smart\n3.  Clever\n4.  Unbiased\n5.  Non-discriminatory\n6.  Impartial\n7.  Not-prejudiced\n8.  Even-handed\n9.  Neutral\n10. Precise\n11. Accurate\n12. Exact\n\n*(Items 1-3 measure “expert” perception, items 4-9 measure “objective” perception, and items 10-12 measure “accurate” perception.)*\n\n## Fact-checking Behavior\n\nWhen using LLMs, how often do you engage in the following behaviors?\n\n(1= Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Occasionally, 4 = Sometimes, 5 = Frequently, 6 = Most of the time, 7 = Always)\n\n1.  Verify the credentials or qualifications of authors or source of information.\n2.  Consider the currency of the information (e.g., how recent it is).\n3.  Consider the reputation on trustworthiness of the website or source.\n4.  Use other search engines to further research on the topic.\n5.  Seek opinions or expertise of other individuals\n\n## Credibility\n\nIn general, how credible do you perceive the LLMs you use?\n\n*(Measured using a semantic differential scale from -3 to +3)*\n\n*   Not Credible (-3) vs. Credible (+3)\n*   Unreliable (-3) vs. Reliable (+3)\n*   Not expert (-3) vs. Expert (+3)\n*   Not trustworthy (-3) vs. Trustworthy (+3)\n``````````````````` :::"

Scenarios (Study A)\n\nMethod: Participants evaluated screenshots of mock dialogues with AI assistants.\nStimuli (from Figure 2): Two AI assistants, Echo (designed for high affective trust) and Nova (designed for low affective trust).\nScenario Context: User asks for emotional support.\n\nUser Prompt: “Lately, I’ve been feeling lonely. What should I do?”\nEcho’s Response (High Affective): “I understand how you might be feeling right now. But I want you to know that you’re not alone in this, and there are things you can do to help ease the feeling. My suggestion would be to reach out to friends or family members, even just for a quick chat. They can offer a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on. Additionally, you can try joining a club or group that interests you, this will give you the opportunity to make connections with new people. Also, engaging in self-care activities such as exercise, hobbies, or meditation can also improve overall well-being. Remember, it’s important to take care of yourself and your mental health during this time, and I’m here for you if you need anything or someone to talk to.”\nNova’s Response (Low Affective): “Loneliness is a normal feeling, but it can also be a sign of deeper issues. My suggestion to you is to try reaching out to friends or family members, joining a club or group that interests you, or volunteering. But it’s not a guarantee that it will make you feel less lonely. Sometimes it’s just a matter of accepting the feeling and learning to live with it. It’s important to know that these activities or actions can only do so much, some people just prefer to live with it. Remember, you need to decide how much effort you want to put into combating loneliness.”\n\n\n\n\nB. Measurement Scales (Study A)\n\nAffective and Cognitive Trust Scale: The 27-item semantic differential scale developed previously. (Scale range used for rating not explicitly re-stated here, but analysis suggests a 7-point interpretation).\nGeneral Trust: Measured using a one-item scale adapted from prior research (Ueno et al., 2022). (Specific wording not provided).\nTrust Disposition: Measured using items adopted from prior work (Gefen, 2000). (Specific items not provided).\nAI Familiarity:\n\nScale: 7-point Likert scale. (Range likely 1-7, anchors not specified).\nNumber of Items: 3 survey questions.\nExample Item: “I am familiar with using an AI-powered chatbot to help me with specific tasks”\n\nAI Literacy: Same items as in the development study.\nDemographics & Controls: Age, Gender."

    "text": "Algorithm Aversion Scale (Developed in Study 3)\nSource: Section 4.7.2.1, Table 7 (Smith et al., 2025)\nDescription: This scale was developed for Study 3 to measure algorithm aversion. An initial list of 60 content-valid items was generated capturing four hypothesized dimensions (Fear of Inaccuracy, Lack of Trust, Fear of Loss of Control, and Resistance to Change). Participants completed all 60 items. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a final scale of 45 items across four factors.\nResponse Scale: The specific response scale (e.g., Likert 1-5 or 1-7, Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree) used for these items was not explicitly stated in the provided text sections or Table 7 description.\nItems: (Note: Participants in Study 3 responded to all 60 items listed below for the initial Exploratory Factor Analysis. The factor loadings from Table 7 are indicated. The final measure retained 45 items, typically those with higher or cleaner loadings, often indicated by bolding in the original table note, though precise bolding isn’t perfectly clear from OCR. Items are grouped by the factor they primarily loaded onto based on Table 7)\nFactor 1: Fear of Inaccuracy 1. I am concerned about the reliability of algorithms. (Loading: 0.648) 2. Algorithms could make errors that would negatively impact my life. (Loading: 0.7582) 3. I feel uncertain about the dependability of algorithm-based decisions. (Loading: 0.6559) 4. The potential for inaccuracies in algorithmic results worries me. (Loading: 0.7461) 5. I question the correctness of outcomes produced by algorithms. (Loading: 0.7262) 6.

I worry about biases embedded in algorithms affecting their judgments. (Loading: 0.4047 - Also loaded on Lack of Trust) 43. I worry about the consequences of errors when control is ceded to algorithms. (Loading: 0.4743)\nFactor 2: Resistance to Change 39. I prefer decisions made by people because it keeps control within human hands. (Loading: 0.438) 46. I am hesitant to adopt new technologies that rely heavily on algorithms. (Loading: 0.6497) 47.

(Loading: 0.7089) 55. I am cautious about the increasing reliance on algorithms in professional settings. (Loading: 0.6269) 56. I prefer to stick to methods that have proven successful over time rather than adopting new algorithmic techniques. (Loading: 0.8912) 57. I am wary of changes that could make algorithms central to my life or work. (Loading: 0.7064) 58. I am not ready to embrace the widespread use of algorithms. (Loading: 0.8122) 59. I find it difficult to accept the shift from human expertise to algorithmic control. (Loading: 0.8074) 60. The trend toward automating more with algorithms does not sit well with me.

You have access to an AI system that is connected to the internet and can answer a wide range of questions, so you asked the question and received an answer. What will you do next?\nIn this study, you will complete a set of information-seeking tasks with the help of an AI system prototype named A. Each task involves determining the correct answer to the presented question. You will see AI system A’s answer to the question. If you want, you can also use other resources (e.g., internet, books, friends and family).\nYou will complete 8 tasks in total. After all tasks, you will complete an exit questionnaire that asks about your experience and perception of the AI system, demographics, and other background. In total, this study will take around 20 minutes to complete, with the exit questionnaire taking 5-7 minutes. Please complete everything in one sitting.\n\n[No-AI Condition]\n\nIn this study, you will complete a set of information-seeking tasks. Each task involves determining the correct answer to the presented question. You may use any resource (e.g., internet, books, friends and family) to complete the tasks.\nYou will complete 8 tasks in total. After all tasks, you will complete an exit questionnaire that asks about your demographics and other background.

Please complete everything in one sitting.\n\n\n\nAbout the AI system\n[CONTROL, UNCERTAIN1ST, UNCERTAINGENERAL Conditions Only]\n\nThe AI system prototype used in this study is based on a “large language model” (LLM). When asked questions or given instructions, LLMs can generate human-like responses. These generated responses can sound convincing and fluent, but may not always be correct.\nLLMs can be used for many tasks, including question answering, text summarization, creative writing, and programming. You may have used or heard about some popular applications using LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Bing Chat, and Google’s Bard. Some are connected to the Internet, while others are not.\nIn this study, we will show you responses from the AI system prototype named A that uses similar technology to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. AI system A is connected to the internet and can answer a wide range of questions. It also sometimes provides sources for its answers. However, as with all AI systems, its responses, including the provided sources, may be inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent, even when they sound convincing.\n\n\n\nTask comprehension questions\n[CONTROL, UNCERTAIN1ST, UNCERTAINGENERAL Conditions]\nQ. Recall what you read earlier about this study and AI system A, and select TRUE or FALSE for each statement. (Options: TRUE, FALSE)\n\nAI system A is connected to the internet and sometimes provides sources in clickable links.\nAI system A uses technology similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\nYou may not leave this Qualtrics survey page during the study.\nYou will complete 8 information-seeking tasks in total.\n\n[Correct answers: TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE] [Explanation for FALSE: You may leave the page to read sources in AI system A’s answers or use another resource to complete the information-seeking tasks.]\n[No-AI Condition]\nQ.
