#### Definition

> We would like to know your opinion on artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence refers to technical devices that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It enables machines to sense, act, and adapt autonomously. Artificial intelligence can be part of a computer program or an online application, but can also be found in various machines such as robots. It can be used in the workplace, in medicine and nursing as well as in education and training.

#### Instruction

> Please indicate your level of agreement for each statement. There are no correct or incorrect answers.

### Artificial Intelligence Experience and Attitude Survey (AIEASM, Gnambs, Griese et al., 2025)

#### Description of AI scenarios

| AI Type               | Workplace                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Healthcare                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Education                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Virtual assistants** | Automated helpdesks are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to address common questions from employees. These programs can be used by companies or public institutions as a point of contact and advice. If employees have questions about products or technical problems, they are answered automatically by email or chat without human intervention. | Medical chatbots are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions about ailments and symptoms of illness. Patients can communicate with the chatbot verbally or via written text entries. When they ask questions about their state of health, they are automatically answered without human intervention. | Virtual assistants are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions from learners about specific knowledge areas. The dialogue takes place either verbally or via written text. When learners pose questions, they are answered automatically without human intervention. |
| **Recommender systems** | Artificial intelligence is used to make suggestions at the workplace as to which tasks need to be completed next and which solutions or work steps are suitable.                                                                                                  | Health apps are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to analyze physical activity, sleep patterns, and dietary habits. They provide personalized recommendations for a healthy lifestyle such as fitness or nutrition plans.      | Learning software uses artificial intelligence to analyze the learning progress of users. It provides personalized recommendations for learning content that has not yet been fully consolidated or for additional topics.             |
| **Robots**              | Industrial robots with artificial intelligence are machines that can independently manufacture new products on the assembly line with little supervision by human operators.                                                                                   | Care robots with artificial intelligence perform physical tasks in hospitals or nursing homes. They help patients with limited mobility to get out of bed, pick up objects, wash themselves, or get dressed.                               | Social Robots with artificial intelligence are machines for interacting with people. They can help learners largely independently and individually, for example by participating in interactive learning or helping with language acquisition. |
| **Predictive analytics** | Artificial intelligence can analyze job applications to identify suitable candidates. For this, it uses information from application documents or behavior in the interview. This helps organizations to predict the likely professional success of a candidate. | Artificial intelligence can use medical scans (images) or information about a patient's lifestyle to predict the risk of certain types of cancer or mental illnesses. This can aid in the development of personalized prevention or treatment plans. | Artificial intelligence can analyze information about participants in a training or further education course to predict which individuals are at risk of performing poorly or dropping out of the course. An early warning system like this can help to identify people at risk and provide the necessary support. |
| **Monitoring**          | Artificial intelligence can automatically monitor the productivity of employees and, for example, analyse computer usage or production and sales figures. This helps companies to optimize work processes and identify employees who need additional support.       | Artificial intelligence can monitor various vital signs such as heart rate or blood pressure. Electronic devices that are worn on the body inform in real-time, for example, about the wearer's health and fitness or potential illnesses. | Computer programs with artificial intelligence can analyze texts from students or participants in training or further education courses to identify plagiarism, that is, text parts written by others.                            |
| **Content generation**  | Artificial intelligence can create new and unique content such as texts, illustrations, or photos. It is used, for example, in marketing to develop catchy slogans for ads, design brand logos, or create fictional advertising photos.                         | Artificial intelligence can analyze medical information about patients to automatically create health reports, doctor's letters, diagnoses, and treatment plans.                                                                            | Artificial intelligence can analyze large amounts of text from textbooks or articles and briefly summarize the most important information. This provides learners with a quick and concise overview of complicated topics.           |
