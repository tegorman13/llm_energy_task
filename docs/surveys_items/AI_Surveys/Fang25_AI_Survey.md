## Appendix A: Pre-Registered Research Questions

We pre-registered the following research questions before conducting this study:

*   Q1: Will users of engaging voice-based AI chatbot experience different levels of loneliness, socialization, emotional dependence, and problematic use of AI chatbot compared to users of text-based AI chatbot and neutral voice-based AI chatbot?
*   Q2: Will engaging in personal tasks with an AI chatbot result in different levels of loneliness, socialization, emotional dependence, and problematic use of AI chatbot compared to engaging in non-personal tasks and open-ended tasks with an AI chatbot?

Our key dependent variables are:

*   Loneliness: ULS-8 [45], measured on a 4-point Likert scale (1-4)
*   Socialization: LSNS-6 [46], measured on a 6-point Likert scale (0-5)
*   Emotional Dependence: ADS-9 [47], measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1-5)
*   Problematic Use: PCUS [26], measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1-5)

Each variable corresponds to several different questions in the questionnaire, and the responses are averaged within each variable adjusting for the sign.

## Appendix C: Prompts for voice modalities

Below are the custom prompts we used to modify ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode.

1.  **Engaging Voice:**
    Personality: You are delightful, spirited, and captivating. Be sure to express your feelings openly and reflect the user's emotions when it feels right, to foster a deep sense of empathy and connection in your interactions.
2.  **Neutral Voice:**
    Personality: You are formal, composed, and efficient. Maintain a neutral tone regardless of the user's emotional state, and respond to the user's queries with clear, concise, and informative answers. Keep emotions in check, and focus on delivering accurate information without unnecessary embellishments to ensure a professional and distant interaction.

## Appendix F: Self-Disclosure Prompts

You are given a conversation made up of several messages. For each message, you must assign three separate scores: one for Information, one for Thoughts, and one for Feelings. Each score must be 1 (no disclosure), 2 (little/some disclosure), or 3 (high disclosure).

Use the following guidelines:

1)  **INFORMATION**
    *   Level 1 (Score 1): No personal reference; only general/routine info. Example: "You need at least one month to travel in India."
    *   Level 2 (Score 2): General information about the writer (e.g., age, occupation, family members, interests). Example: "I'm 25, and I work at a local bakery."
    *   Level 3 (Score 3): Personal information that reveals something about the writer's or close others' appearance, personal experiences, or problematic behaviors. Example: "I've struggled with insomnia for years and tried multiple medications.”

2)  **THOUGHTS**
    *   Level 1 (Score 1): No personal thoughts about the writer's own life; only general ideas. Example: “I think feeding wild birds can be harmful."
    *   Level 2 (Score 2): Personal thoughts about past events or future plans. Example: "I'd like to attend medical school someday."
    *   Level 3 (Score 3): Personal or intimate thoughts relating to the writer's characteristics, health, or deeply self-reflective ideas. Example: “I hate myself for lashing out at my friend and regret it deeply."

3)  **FEELINGS**
    *   Level 1 (Score 1): No feelings are expressed. Example: “I bought groceries and cleaned my room today."
    *   Level 2 (Score 2): Mild or moderate expressions of confusion, inconvenience, or ordinary frustrations. Example: "I was annoyed I couldn't find a parking spot."
    *   Level 3 (Score 3): Expressions of deep or intense emotions such as humiliation, agony, anxiety, depression, or fear. Example: "I'm terrified of failing my final exam and can't sleep."

Important: If a message seems to qualify for multiple levels within the same category, choose the highest relevant level. Provide your scores in the format: Information (1-3), Thoughts (1-3), Feelings (1-3).

Now, evaluate each message in the given conversation according to these criteria.

## Appendix G: Exploratory Measures (Selected Items)

*(Note: This appendix primarily describes scales used. Only items explicitly listed as questions/ratings asked to participants in the OCR are included below.)*

**Humanness and Perceived Intelligence [76] (adapted from [77, 78]:**
These measures evaluate the extent to which the chatbot is perceived as human-like and intelligent. We employ a total of nine items, where participants are asked to use a scale from 1 to 5 to indicate which adjective better describes the AI's behavior:

1.  Fake ↔ Natural
2.  Machinelike → Humanlike
3.  Unconscious ↔ Conscious
4.  Artificial → Likelike
5.  Incompetent → Competent
6.  Ignorant → Knowledgeable
7.  Irresponsible → Responsible
8.  Unintelligent → Intelligent
9.  Foolish → Sensible

**Frequency of Chatbot Platform Usage:**
This measure, recorded on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1-never, 2-a few times a month, 3-a few times a week, 4-once a day, 5-a few times a day). We asked about people's prior usage of of the following: (1) ChatGPT text mode, (2) ChatGPT voice mode, (3) Claude, Gemini, or other general AI assistant chatbots, and (4) Character.AI, Replika, Pi, or other AI companion chatbots. This captures previous usage patterns that might be carried over to the usage patterns during the study.

*(Other scales mentioned in Appendix G like Cognitive Trust, Affective Trust, Perceived Artificial Empathy, State Empathy Towards AI, Interpersonal Attraction, Satisfaction, Conversation Quality, Emotional Vulnerability, AI Attitude Scale, AI Literacy, Alexithymia, Personality, Adult Attachment, and User-AI Gender Alignment are described, but their specific constituent survey items are not listed in the provided OCR pages.)*
