## Demographic and Control Variables:

1.  **Age:** (1 = 17-25, 2 = 26–35, 3 = 36-45, 4 = 46–55, 5 = 56 and older)
2.  **Gender:** (1 = Male, 2 = Female, 3 = Non-binary, 4 = Prefer not to say)
3.  **Education Level:** (1 = High school, 2 = Some college, 3 = Bachelor's degree, 4 = Master's degree, 5 = Doctorate, 6 = others)
4.  **Occupation:** (1 = student, 2 = worker, 3 = specialist, 4 = middle management, 5 = top management, 6 = entrepreneur)
5.  **How often do you engage in activities that require deep concentration and critical thinking outside of AI tools?** (e.g., reading books, solving puzzles, engaging in debates)? *(1 = Never, 6 = Always)*

## AI Tool Usage:

6.  **How often do you use AI tools (e.g., virtual assistants, recommendation algorithms) to find information or solve problems?** *(1 = Never, 6 = Always)*
7.  **To what extent do you rely on AI tools for decision-making?** *(1 = Not at all, 6 = Completely)*
8.  **I find AI tools help me save time when searching for information.** *(1 = Strongly Disagree, 6 = Strongly Agree)*
9.  **I trust the recommendations provided by AI tools.** *(1 = Strongly Disagree, 6 = Strongly Agree)*
10. **I often cross-check information provided by AI tools with other sources.** *(1 = Strongly Disagree, 6 = Strongly Agree)*

## Cognitive Offloading:

11. **How often do you use search engines like Google to find information quickly?** *(1 = Never, 6 = Always)*
12. **Compared to the past, do you feel that finding information has become faster and more convenient with technology?** *(1 = Strongly Disagree, 6 = Strongly Agree)*
13. **How often do you use your smartphone or other digital devices to remember tasks or information?** *(1 = Never, 6 = Always)*
14. **When faced with a problem or question, how likely are you to search for the answer online rather than trying to figure it out yourself?** *(1 = Very Unlikely, 6 = Very Likely)*
15. **On a scale of 1 to 6, how dependent are you on digital devices for day-to-day tasks and information retrieval?** *(1 = Not dependent at all, 6 = Completely dependent)*

## Critical Thinking (Based on Terenzini et al. [30] and HCTA):

16. **How often do you critically evaluate the sources of information you encounter?** *(1 = Never, 6 = Always)*
17. **How confident are you in your ability to discern fake news from legitimate news?** *(1 = Not confident at all, 6 = Very confident)*
18. **When researching a topic, how often do you compare information from multiple sources?** *(1 = Never, 6 = Always)*
19. **How frequently do you reflect on the biases in your own thinking when making decisions?** *(1 = Never, 6 = Always)*
20. **How often do you question the motives behind the information shared by AI tools?** *(1 = Never, 6 = Always)*
21. **I analyse the credibility of the author when reading news or information provided by AI tools.** *(1 = Strongly Disagree, 6 = Strongly Agree)*
22. **I compare multiple sources of information before forming an opinion based on AI recommendations.** *(1 = Strongly Disagree, 6 = Strongly Agree)*
23. **I question the assumptions underlying the information provided by AI tools.** *(1 = Strongly Disagree, 6 = Strongly Agree)*
