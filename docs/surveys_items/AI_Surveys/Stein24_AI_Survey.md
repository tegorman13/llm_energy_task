## Core Instrument: Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (ATTARI-12)

**(Source: ATTARI-12, English version definition page & Study Questionnaires)**

**Instruction:**

> In the following, we are interested in your attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI). AI can execute tasks that typically require human intelligence. It enables machines to sense, act, learn, and adapt in an autonomous, human-like way. AI may be part of a computer or online platform—but it can also be encountered in various other hardware devices such as robots.

**Items:**

(Response Scale: 5-point Likert scale, 1 = Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree)

1.  AI will make this world a better place. *(Cognitive, Positive)*
2.  I have strong negative emotions about AI. *(Affective, Negative - reverse-coded)*
3.  I want to use technologies that rely on AI. *(Behavioral, Positive)*
4.  AI has more disadvantages than advantages. *(Cognitive, Negative - reverse-coded)*
5.  I look forward to future AI developments. *(Affective, Positive)*
6.  AI offers solutions to many world problems. *(Cognitive, Positive)*
7.  I prefer technologies that do not feature AI. *(Behavioral, Negative - reverse-coded)*
8.  I am afraid of AI. *(Affective, Negative - reverse-coded)*
9.  I would rather choose a technology with AI than one without it. *(Behavioral, Positive)*
10. AI creates problems rather than solving them. *(Cognitive, Negative - reverse-coded)*
11. When I think about AI, I have mostly positive feelings. *(Affective, Positive)*
12. I would rather avoid technologies that are based on AI. *(Behavioral, Negative - reverse-coded)*

## Study 1: Scale Validation Measures

**(Source: ATTARI-12: Study 1 (Validation) Questionnaire OCR)**

### 1. ATTARI-12

*   (See Core Instrument section above)

### 2. Attitudes Towards Personal Voice Assistants (PVA)

**Instruction:**

> Now we are interested in your opinion regarding *personal voice assistants* (e.g. Alexa, Echo, Siri or Bixby). Personal voice assistants may be embedded in phones, tablets, smart-speakers, or other small hardware devices. They are responsive to the user's voice and may react to a large number of vocal commands (such as "Start a call to Sarah" or "Dim the lights to 20%"). Please indicate how you are feeling about personal voice assistants.

**Items:**

(Response Scale: 5-point semantic differential)

1.  hate it (1) --- (5) love it
2.  negative (1) --- (5) positive
3.  repulsive (1) --- (5) attractive

### 3. Attitudes Towards Robots

**Instruction 1:**

> Now we are interested in your evaluation of *robots*. A robot is a machine which can assist humans in everyday tasks without constant guidance or instruction, e.g. as a kind of co-worker helping on the factory floor or as a robot cleaner, or in activities which may be dangerous for humans, like search and rescue in disasters.

**Item 1:**

(Response Scale: 4-point scale)

*   Generally speaking, do you have a very positive, fairly positive, fairly negative or very negative view of robots?
    *   0 = very negative
    *   1 = fairly negative
    *   2 = fairly positive
    *   3 = very positive

**Instruction 2:**

> Please indicate below how much you agree with the following statements.

**Items 2 & 3:**

(Response Scale: 4-point Likert scale, 0 = totally disagree, 3 = totally agree)

*   Robots are a good thing for societies because they help people.
*   Robots are necessary as they can do jobs that are too hard or too dangerous for people.

### 4. Social Desirability Scale (Likely SDS-17, 16 items shown)
