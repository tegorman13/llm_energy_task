### B.1 Participant Recruitment Details

Custom pre-screening questions:

1.  Did you obtain a degree, are you pursuing a degree, or do you work in an area related to computer science?
    *   Yes
    *   No
2.  How would you rate your current knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI)?

### B.2 Full Survey

#### B.2.1 Baseline Instructions

> Your task is to fill out a rating survey on your beliefs about current large language models (LLMs) based on your prior experience. In the first part, you will see a list of capabilities and rate how capable you believe current LLMs are of each item on a scale of 1 (not at all capable) to 7 (highly capable). In the second part, you will rate several statements about current LLMs.

**Task Comprehension Check (Baseline):**

> Let's make sure you understand your task. You will not be able to proceed until you select the correct answer.
> Which of the following best describes your task?
> *   Watch a video on LLMs and fill out a rating survey on your beliefs about current LLMs
> *   **Fill out a rating survey on your beliefs about current LLMs**
> *   Listen to an audio podcast on LLMs and fill out a rating survey on your beliefs about LLMs
> *   Watch a video on LLMs and write a free response essay about your views of current LLMs

*(Note: Correct answer is bolded. Order randomized)*

#### B.2.2 Experimental Conditions Instructions and Stimuli Presentation

> In this task, you will watch three short videos (<5 minutes total) to teach you about large language models (LLMs). You may pause and rewatch parts of the video as needed and can go back to previous videos, but you must stay on each video's page for at least the duration of the video.
> Following the video, your task is to:
> (1) Answer 1-2 questions based on the video content and
> (2) Fill out a rating survey on your beliefs about current large language models (LLMs) based on your prior experience and what you learned in the video. In the first part, you will see a list of capabilities and rate how capable you believe current LLMs are of each item on a scale of 1 (not at all capable) to 7 (highly capable). In the second part, you will rate several statements about current LLMs.

**Task Comprehension Check (Experimental Conditions):**

> Let's make sure you understand your task. You will not be able to proceed until you select the correct answer.

> *   Only fill out a rating survey on your beliefs about current LLMs
> *   Listen to an audio podcast on LLMs and fill out a rating survey on your beliefs about current LLMs
