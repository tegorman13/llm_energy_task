In the following, you will read descriptions of different abilities that one can have when dealing with artificial intelligence. These abilities can be more or less pronounced. Please rate yourself: How pronounced are your abilities?

A value of **0** means that an ability is *not at all or hardly pronounced*. A value of **10** means that an ability is *very well or (almost) perfectly pronounced*.

Please circle the value that best describes your ability.

## Scoring Instructions

The Meta-Artificial Intelligence Literacy Scale is divided into the following sections. To determine the individual values, a mean score must be calculated from the corresponding items. Artificial Intelligence Literacy

### AI Literacy
*   Detect AI: Item 1
*   Apply AI: Item 7
*   Understand AI: Item 10
*   AI Ethics: Item 5
*(Note: Calculate the mean of items 1, 5, 7, 10 for the AI Literacy score)*

### Create AI
*   Items 2, 6
*(Note: Calculate the mean of items 2 and 6 for the Create AI score)*

### AI Self-Efficacy
*   Learning: Item 3
*   AI Problem-Solving: Item 8
*(Note: Calculate the mean of items 3 and 8 for the AI Self-Efficacy score)*

### AI Self-Competency
*   Persuasion Literacy: Item 9
*   Emotion Regulation: Item 4
*(Note: Calculate the mean of items 4 and 9 for the AI Self-Competency score)*
