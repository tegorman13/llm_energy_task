## Appendix II: Adaptive Berlin Numeracy Test Format

**Instructions:** Please answer the questions that follow. Do not use a calculator but feel free to use scratch paper for notes.

*(Note: The adaptive format presents questions sequentially based on previous answers, following the structure outlined in Figure 1 of the original paper. The online version at www.riskliteracy.org implements this logic automatically. For manual administration, follow the branching logic described in the paper.)*

**Question Pool:**

1.  Out of 1,000 people in a small town 500 are members of a choir. Out of these 500 members in the choir 100 are men. Out of the 500 inhabitants that are not in the choir 300 are men. What is the probability that a randomly drawn man is a member of the choir? Please indicate the probability in percent. \_\_\_\_%
    *(Correct Answer: 25)*

2a. Imagine we are throwing a five-sided die 50 times. On average, out of these 50 throws how many times would this five-sided die show an odd number (1, 3 or 5)? \_\_\_\_ out of 50 throws.
    *(Correct Answer: 30)*

2b. Imagine we are throwing a loaded die (6 sides). The probability that the die shows a 6 is twice as high as the probability of each of the other numbers. On average, out of these 70 throws how many times would the die show the number 6? \_\_\_\_ out of 70 throws.
    *(Correct Answer: 20)*

3.  In a forest 20% of mushrooms are red, 50% brown and 30% white. A red mushroom is poisonous with a probability of 20%. A mushroom that is not red is poisonous with a probability of 5%. What is the probability that a poisonous mushroom in the forest is red? \_\_\_\_%
    *(Correct Answer: 50)*

**Scoring:** Based on answers to 2-3 questions following the adaptive structure, typically resulting in a quartile score (1-4).

## Appendix III: Berlin Numeracy Test Traditional Paper and Pencil Format

**Instructions:**  
Please answer all four questions **without a calculator**. Feel free to use the space available for notes (i.e., scratch paper).

1.  Imagine we are throwing a five-sided die 50 times. On average, out of these 50 throws how many times would this five-sided die show an odd number (1, 3 or 5)?
    \_\_\_\_ out of 50 throws.
    *(Correct Answer: 30)*

2.  Out of 1,000 people in a small town 500 are members of a choir. Out of these 500 members in the choir 100 are men. Out of the 500 inhabitants that are not in the choir 300 are men. What is the probability that a randomly drawn man is a member of the choir? (please indicate the probability in percent).
    \_\_\_\_%
    *(Correct Answer: 25)*

3.  Imagine we are throwing a loaded die (6 sides). The probability that the die shows a 6 is twice as high as the probability of each of the other numbers. On average, out of these 70 throws, how many times would the die show the number 6?
    \_\_\_\_ out of 70 throws.
    *(Correct Answer: 20)*

4.  In a forest 20% of mushrooms are red, 50% brown and 30% white. A red mushroom is poisonous with a probability of 20%. A mushroom that is not red is poisonous with a probability of 5%. What is the probability that a poisonous mushroom in the forest is red?
    \_\_\_\_%
    *(Correct Answer: 50)*

**Scoring:** Count the total number of correct answers (0-4 points possible).

## Appendix IV: Berlin Numeracy Test Single Item (Median) Format

**Instructions:** Please answer the questions below. Do not use a calculator but feel free to use the space available for notes (i.e., scratch paper).

1.  Out of 1,000 people in a small town 500 are members of a choir. Out of these 500 members in the choir 100 are men. Out of the 500 inhabitants that are not in the choir 300 are men. What is the probability that a randomly drawn man is a member of the choir? (please indicate the probability in percent).
    \_\_\_\_%
    *(Correct Answer: 25)*

**Scoring:** Score as 1 if correct, 0 if incorrect. Used for median split estimation.
