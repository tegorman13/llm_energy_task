## 2. Energy Consumed by the Average Household

Think about an average household in the United States.

Now think about the total amount of energy that is used directly by that household in one year.

Consider that the energy used by a household can be divided into household operations, transportation and food production.

*   Household operations include electricity, natural gas, and heating oil that is used for the house.
*   Transportation includes air travel, motor travel, and public transportation used by people in the household.
*   Food production includes growing and shipping food that people in the household eat.

> Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs).

1.  What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by household operations? ____
2.  What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by transportation? ____
3.  What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by food production? ____

## 4. Energy Saved in the Household

Turning off a 100-Watt incandescent light bulb for one hour SAVES 100 units of energy.

How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

> Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Your best estimates are fine.

## 5. Energy Saved in Transportation

Assume that a 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour uses 100 units of energy in one hour.
(Note that this scale in different from that used in previous questions, in that "100 units" now refers to a different amount of energy.)

How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

> Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than is consumed by the 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than consumed by the 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Your best estimates are fine.
