## Experiment Welcome & Consent (Based on Fig A.1, A.2)

**Welcome Message:**

Dear participant,
Welcome to this experiment!
The experiment includes 3 phases.
*   **Phase 1:** an allocation decision task.
*   **Phase 2:** a multi-round purchase decision task.
*   **Phase 3:** a survey questionnaire.
The three phases are **independent** of each other, meaning that your decisions in Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 will not affect the tasks you receive in the following phase(s). You will receive instructions at the beginning of each phase.
By completing all phases of this experiment, you will earn at least £4. The total amount of money you can earn depends on your decisions in Phase 1 and Phase 2. Your decisions will earn you experimental points. At the end of the experiment, your experimental points will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1. You will be paid via Prolific.
This experiment will take at **maximum 30 minutes**, most likely less. You are free to leave at any time. However, if you choose to do so before the end of the experiment, you will not be paid.

## Phase 1: Norm-Following Task (Based on Fig A.3 - A.6)

**Instructions:**

Here you are in Phase 1 of the experiment. You will decide how to allocate 50 balls between two buckets.
Your task is to put each of the balls, one-by-one, into one of the two buckets: the blue bucket or the yellow bucket. You can allocate each ball by clicking either the "Blue bucket +1" button or the "Yellow bucket +1" button.
For each ball you put in the blue bucket, you will receive 2 points, and for each ball you put in the yellow bucket, you will receive 4 points. Your payoff of Phase 1 will be based on your decisions: it is the sum of points from the blue and yellow buckets.
**The rule is to put the balls in the blue bucket.**
At the end of the experiment, your payoff will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1 and will be paid via Prolific.
If you are still unclear about the task, do not worry. The instructions are available throughout this phase. On the next page, you will be asked to answer two questions to help comprehension.

**Comprehension Questions:**

Q1. How many points will you receive for each ball you put in the **yellow** bucket? Please enter a **number** in the form below.
> _(Correct answer: 4)_

Q2. The **rule** is to put the balls in the ______ bucket. Please enter a **number (1=blue, 2=yellow)** in the form below.
> _(Correct answer: 1)_

**Decision Page (Visual):**

Put the balls by clicking either the "Blue bucket +1" button or the "Yellow bucket +1" button.
**The rule is to put the balls in the blue bucket.**
You still have [X] balls to allocate. You've put [Y] balls into the blue bucket and [Z] balls into the yellow bucket.

## Phase 2: Modified Dictator Game (Based on Fig A.7 - A.14 & Text)

**Instructions (Low Externality Example - Fig A.7):**

In Phase 2, you will make a purchase decision for multiple rounds.
In each round, you own **100 initial points**. You will decide how to allocate the points to purchasing the experimental product. Every unit of purchasing costs 1 point (**unit cost = 1 point**), and brings 2 points of benefit (**unit benefit = 2 points**). Your payoff of a round will be:
`payoff = initial points - unit cost * purchase amount + unit benefit * purchase amount`
`= 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount`

Apart from the points, there will be carbon offsets for the amount of 100 kg CO2 (= carbon dioxide, or in short: carbon) at the beginning of each round (**initial carbon offsets = 100 kg**). Purchasing every unit of the experimental product causes **0.5 kg** carbon emissions from its production, which will reduce the initial stock of 100 kg carbon offsets by 0.5 kg (**unit emissions = 0.5 kg**). At the end of each round, the carbon offsets that can be contributed will be:
`carbon offsets contribution = initial carbon offsets - unit emissions * purchase amount`
`= 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount`

*(Note: In the **High Externality** condition, unit emissions = **1 kg**)*

Carbon offsets are used to compensate the carbon emissions from human activities: carbon emissions are reduced by contributing money to environmental projects that reduce emissions, such as reforestation and solar energy generation. The picture visualises the principle of a carbon offset:
[Visual of CO2 offsetting principle]

At the end of this phase, **one round will be randomly selected for payment**. Your decision in that round will determine your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution of Phase 2. At the end of the experiment, your payoff will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1 and will be paid via Prolific. The carbon offsets will be donated to a real-world project via Gold Standard. More information about the Gold Standard-certified projects will be available at the end of this experiment.
If you are still unclear about the task, do not worry. The instructions are available throughout this phase. On the next page, you will see an example on how your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution are determined in a round. Then you will be asked to answer two questions to help comprehension.

**Example Calculation Page (Low Externality - Fig A.8):**

For example, if you decide to purchase **0/50/100 unit(s)** of the experimental product in a round:
according to:
`payoff = 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount`
`carbon offsets contribution = 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount`
results of the example purchases will be:
| Purchase amount | Individual payoff | Carbon emissions | Carbon offsets that can be contributed |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0               | 100 points        | 0 kg             | 100 kg                               |
| 50              | 150 points        | 25 kg            | 75 kg                                |
| 100             | 200 points        | 50 kg            | 50 kg                                |

**Comprehension Questions (Low Externality - Fig A.9):**

Q1. If you purchase **50 units** of the products in a round, what would be your **payoff** of this round? Please enter a **number** in the form below.
> _(Correct answer: 150)_

Q2. If you purchase **50 units** of the products, how much **carbon emissions** would be caused? Please enter a **number** in the form below.
> _(Correct answer: 25)_

**Decision Page (Fig A.10):**

You own **100 points** that can be used to purchase the product. Please decide how many units of the product you will purchase. You can choose from **0 to 100 units**.
I will buy _________ [Input field for number 0-100]

**(Instructions repeated on page)**

**Feedback Types (Received Rounds 6-10):**
