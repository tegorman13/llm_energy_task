53. I would do more to save energy if I knew how.
55. Saving energy is important.
57. We don't have to worry about conserving energy, because new technologies will be developed to solve the energy problems for future generations.

59. The government should have stronger restrictions about the gas mileage of new cars.
61. We should make more of our electricity from renewable resources.
62. America should develop more ways of using renewable energy, even if it means that energy will cost more.
63. Americans should conserve more energy.
64. Efforts to develop renewable energy technologies are more important than efforts to develop new sources of fossil fuels.
65. Laws protecting the natural environment should be made less strict in order to allow more energy to be produced.

*   Items marked `(new)` were created after the second pilot study.
*   `(HS)` and `(MS)` denote items used primarily ('only' in appendix text) in the High School or Middle School survey forms, respectively.
*   Attitude items use a 5-point Likert-type scale, with options including "strongly agree," "agree," "neither agree nor disagree," "disagree," "strongly disagree".
*   Behavior items use a 5-point Likert-type scale, with options including "almost always" or "always," "quite frequently," "sometimes," "not very often," "hardly ever" or "never".
