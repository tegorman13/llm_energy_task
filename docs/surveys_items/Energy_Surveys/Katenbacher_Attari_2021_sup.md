## Supplementary Methods 1: Expert interview materials and protocol


### Introduction to participants

We are interested in how people with different forms of expertise and professional experience think about and approach the topic of energy use in the home.

In the course of this interview, I will be asking you different types of questions to access your thinking about different facets of energy use in the home. The questions will be delivered and answered orally. The two mains tasks for this session are:

1.  A behavior choice task, where I will ask you to think through the relative energy costs or savings potential of various routine appliances and activities
2.  An estimation task, wherein you will provide an estimate of the energy consumed by various household appliances

After completing these tasks, I will ask that you share some reflections on the tasks and the ways that your experience and expertise informed your approaches. We will finish with a brief final set of questions about your background.

### Open-ended questions

1.  How much do you think about the amount of energy you use on a day-to-day basis?
2.  How does thinking about energy use factor into your professional life?
3.  What actions have you taken in the past to reduce your personal energy consumption?

### Talk-aloud protocol warm-up¹

We are interested in what you say to yourself as you perform the next task. I will ask you to talk aloud as you work on the problems. What I mean by talk aloud is that I want you to say out loud everything that you that you say yourself silently. Just act as if you are alone in the room, speaking to yourself. If you are silent for any length of time, I will remind you to keep talking aloud.

Before we turn to the main task, we will start with a couple of practice problems. I want you to talk aloud while you do these problems.

*   First, I want to ask you to add 82 and 18 in your head.
*   Next, I would like you to tell me how many windows are in your house.

### Choice task

### Estimation task

*\[These appliances will all appear on one page in a table format as shown below; correct values have been added in parentheses but were not included in the original document; presented to participants in paper form is interview is in person, presented online via Qualtrics if interview is remote]*

A standard incandescent light bulb uses about **100 units of energy** in one hour. When you are asked to estimate units of energy, please compare each appliance to this light bulb. Think about whether each appliance below uses **less energy or more energy** than this light bulb. Please use this number to help you make your estimates.

How many **units of energy** do you think each of the following devices typically consumes if used for **one hour**? Please provide you best estimates. Enter whole numbers with no other text (no decimals, ranges, or percentages).

**Q2 Do you have any additional rules about home energy use that you would like to see added to the above set of rules?**


## Supplementary Table 1: Choice task codebook

To extract the list of heuristics employed by experts during the choice task, the verbal reports made by the participants were transcribed and analyzed. The first layer of analysis entailed developing a coding scheme to categorize the content of the verbal reports. A codebook was developed to sort the information used by the experts into primary and secondary categories. Primary codes were developed for the three general content areas of the expert interviews: references to (1) observable cues about energy use, (2) device functions, and (3) device components. Each primary code was disaggregated into several secondary codes, each of which refers to a more detailed aspect of the primary code's general theme. For example, the *“Observable Cues”* primary code family contained eight secondary codes, including *“hot to touch,”* *“dims lights/trips circuits,”* and *“thick cord.”*

## Supplementary Table 2: Novice heuristics

The following set of 24 heuristics were collected by van den Broek and Walker (2019)². The accuracy of the heuristics in **bold** was evaluated in Survey 2.

1.  When the device can be set on a higher unit (e.g., higher temperature) the device uses more energy
2.  The more a device produces heat to heat up air or water or itself, the more energy it consumes
3.  The fast a device completes its task, the more energy the device consumes
4.  More active devices use more energy
5.  **Larger devices consume more energy**
6.  Knowledge about the energy consumption of the device that stems from public discourse or an unspecified sources
7.  Devices with similar functions consume same levels of energy while devices with different functions consume different levels of energy
8.  **Devices with a lot of components use more energy**
9.  **Devices use less energy in the utility phase compared to its use in a 'preparation phase'**
10. Devices that use a lot of Wattage consume more energy
11. Devices that reduce the temperature of an element such as air or water will consume high levels of energy
12. Devices that have previously cut out the fuse box consume a lot of energy
13. **Devices that have an initial heating up period consume more energy than devices that do not**
14. **Devices that have an energy label use more energy**
15. Devices that complete several tasks (either simultaneous or successive), or large tasks, consume more energy

## Supplementary Analysis

### Power Analysis

Power analysis performed with *G\*Power* (v3.1; (3)) indicates that a sample size of 67 experts would have been suitable to detect correlations with medium effect sizes (r = 0.3) at 1 – β = 0.80. Given this study's sample of 30 experts, the effect size would have needed to be 0.45 or so to have a reasonable chance of detecting a significant correlation between the various measure of expert performance on the estimation task and experts' self-assessed relevance of their expertise (see Section 3.1).

### Correctness as a Function of Wattage Proximity

To test whether expert performance on the choice task was dependent on the magnitude of difference between devices, we examined the correlation between these two terms. Expert performance was measured in terms of the number of experts (out of 30) who correctly selected the appliance with the lowest energy use. Wattage difference was assessed by taking the logarithmic difference between the device with the second-lowest wattage and the device with the lowest wattage within each choice set (see Table S1 below). The correlation between expert performance and wattage difference (r = 0.14, p = 0.72) was small and non-significant, suggesting that expert choice performance was not dependent on the magnitude between choice wattages.
