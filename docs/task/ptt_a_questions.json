      "instructions": "Now we are interested in your opinions about automated technology – i.e., technology that can perform certain functions automatically without any input from you. Automated technology is taking on more and more tasks in various areas of life. For example, robots are becoming more widely used in industry and in private households. Many means of transport (airplanes, trains, or cars) are also now increasingly automated. The term automated technology includes (among other things): Automated means of transport (e.g. autonomous cars, trains, streetcars, airplanes), Industrial robots (e.g. assembly robots, automated logistics robots), Service and assistance robots (e.g. robot vacuum cleaners, robot lawn mowers, healthcare robots), Other programs and systems based on artificial intelligence (e.g. language assistants, image recognition). There are a number of statements on the next pages about automated technology in general that may apply to you more or less. Please respond to each of these statements by indicating the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement, i.e. how much it applies to you. There are five options available, ranging from \"strongly disagree” to “strongly agree\".",
      "scoring_notes": "Items should be presented in a randomized order. Some items are negatively poled (indicated by (R) - reversed item). A five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree\") was used. Items included in the 6-items short scales are printed in bold in the original publication."
