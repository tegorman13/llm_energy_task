In cognitive psychology research assessing individuals' perceptions of household energy consumption, obtaining accurate "ground truth" values for appliance energy use is crucial for evaluating the accuracy of those perceptions (Lesic et al., 2018). Researchers have employed several methods to acquire these actual or estimated energy consumption figures, each with distinct advantages and limitations.

One common approach involves using general estimates derived from existing literature and publicly available sources. These sources may include expert reports, governmental energy statistics, or data from manufacturers or retailers (Baird & Brier, 1981; Becker et al., 1979; Kempton et al., 1985; Mettler-Meibom & Wichmann, 1982; Schley & DeKay, 2015). For example, studies by Attari et al. (2010) and Frederick et al. (2011) evaluated perceptions against actual energy use figures estimated from literature and government agencies. Similarly, Camilleri et al. (2019) calculated actual appliance energy use values by averaging data from multiple sources. While readily accessible, a significant limitation of this method is its inability to capture the variability and heterogeneity of energy consumption in individual households. Actual consumption varies based on specific appliance models, usage patterns, and environmental conditions (Camilleri et al., 2019).

Another method utilizes estimates based on self-reported appliance usage by participants (Abrahamse & Steg, 2009; Abrahamse et al., 2007; Gatersleben et al., 2002). This allows comparisons between perceived and reported actual usage patterns. However, self-reports can be inaccurate due to imperfect memory, response biases, or participants lacking precise knowledge of their usage. They can also be labor-intensive for participants.

Some studies have relied on household-level meter readings provided by utility companies (Easton & Smith, 2010; Kempton & Montgomery, 1982). This provides household-specific data, enabling researchers to compare individual perceptions with their total household consumption. A major drawback is that these readings typically only provide aggregate household consumption, not disaggregated data for specific appliances. Additionally, historical readings were often monthly, lacking granularity.

The most accurate approach for obtaining appliance-level ground truth is through real-time, high-frequency metering or smart meter data with disaggregation techniques (Chen et al., 2015). Chen et al. (2015) used smart meter data combined with high-frequency load monitoring to assess electricity use at the appliance level. Lesic et al. (2019) specifically utilized direct-metered device-level submeter electricity use data from participants' homes, noting this was the first study to do so to compare perceived versus actual appliance consumption. While offering high accuracy, appliance-level metering campaigns are costly, data can be complex to process, and samples are often localized and not necessarily representative of a wider population (Barsanti et al., 2024; Lesic et al., 2018). Eirinaki et al. (2022) mention using disaggregated appliance-level energy consumption as ground truth for evaluating disaggregation algorithms.

Estimates derived from various sources provide a basis for evaluating consumer perceptions, although values can vary between sources due to differing methodologies or the inherent variability in appliance performance and usage (Camilleri et al., 2019). Below is a table summarizing the ground truth estimates for appliance energy use found within the provided sources, typically representing energy consumption per hour of use.

In the field of cognitive psychology, particularly concerning environmental behavior and energy literacy, assessing individuals' understanding of household energy consumption necessitates a comparison between their subjective perceptions and objective, or "ground truth," values. Understanding how researchers establish this ground truth is critical to evaluating the validity and generalizability of findings regarding consumer misperceptions (Lesic et al., 2018). The process involves various methodological approaches, each with distinct advantages and limitations, contributing to the multifaceted framework researchers employ to probe this complex domain.

### Methods for Obtaining Ground Truth Energy Consumption Values

Establishing the actual energy consumption or savings potential of household appliances or behaviors is a foundational step in assessing the accuracy of human judgments. Researchers have adopted several methods to acquire these ground truth values, reflecting different levels of precision, scope, and cost. These methods can be broadly categorized based on the data source and collection technique:

1.  **General Estimates from Existing Literature and Other Sources:** This approach involves consulting publicly available data from sources such as governmental agencies, expert reports, or even product specifications found in stores or online catalogues (Attari et al., 2010; Baird & Brier, 1981; Becker et al., 1979; Cowen & Gatersleben, 2017; Frederick et al., 2011; Kempton et al., 1985; Mettler-Meibom & Wichmann, 1982; Schley & DeKay, 2015). The advantage of this method is its convenience and very low cost. Researchers can readily access average energy consumption figures or ranges for various appliances. However, a significant limitation is the lack of individual heterogeneity in consumption. Average values derived from national statistics or generalized product data may not accurately reflect the actual energy use of a specific household, which is influenced by factors like device age, maintenance, usage patterns, and environmental conditions. This makes it challenging to determine if discrepancies between perceived and actual consumption are due to the consumer's misperception or the inadequacy of the proxy ground truth.
2.  **Estimates Based on Self-Reported Energy Use:** Some studies have relied on participants' self-reports of their appliance usage patterns (Abrahamse et al., 2007; Abrahamse & Steg, 2009; Gatersleben et al., 2002). Researchers might ask participants about the frequency or duration of appliance use and combine this with standard energy consumption figures to estimate total usage or savings. The benefit here is that the estimates are based on individuals' own reported usage patterns. However, self-reports are susceptible to inaccuracies stemming from imperfect memory, biases (e.g., social desirability), or participants simply not knowing the required information. Furthermore, this approach can be labor-intensive for participants, particularly when covering numerous appliances or behaviors.
3.  **Estimates Based on Household-Level Meter Readings:** This method involves obtaining aggregate energy consumption data for an entire household, typically from utility company meter readings (Easton & Smith, 2010; Kempton & Montgomery, 1982). This provides household-specific information, allowing researchers to compare individuals' perceptions of their total usage with their actual metered consumption. This approach has been used since the late 1970s. While providing a more accurate picture of overall household consumption than general estimates, a key limitation is that household-level readings do not provide information on the energy consumption of specific appliances. Additionally, reliance on monthly readings, often estimated by utilities for much of the year, can reduce the precision of the data.
4.  **Measures of Real-Time Energy Usage from Smart Meters or Submeters:** Considered the most accurate method for understanding appliance-level energy consumption, this involves deploying smart meters or submeters that monitor electricity use at high frequency, often down to the individual appliance level (Chen et al., 2015; Lesic et al., 2019). This method allows researchers to capture the temporal and volume heterogeneity of energy consumption within households. Real-time, appliance-level data can empower consumers to manage usage effectively and provide highly accurate data for researchers. Lesic et al. (2019) highlight their use of direct-metered device-level data as the first study to use such precise measurements to compare with consumer perceptions, contrasting it with previous work relying on estimates from the literature. Despite the high accuracy, this method is associated with very high costs, making large-scale, representative samples challenging to obtain. The data can also be complex, requiring sophisticated analysis techniques like disaggregation algorithms to separate individual appliance loads from aggregate meter data.

The variation in these methods for measuring actual energy use, alongside differences in how perceived energy use is measured (e.g., reference points, units, time periods), contributes to the methodological heterogeneity observed across studies assessing consumer perceptions (Lesic et al., 2018). This heterogeneity complicates the synthesis and comparison of findings in the literature.

### Philosophical Underpinnings: Defining "Truth" in a Dynamic System

From a philosophical perspective, defining "ground truth" for something as dynamic and context-dependent as household energy consumption poses challenges. Is the "truth" the average consumption across all households? The consumption of a specific model under controlled laboratory conditions? Or the actual consumption of a particular appliance in a specific home under real-world, variable usage?

Studies often rely on standardized measures, such as energy use per hour of *continuous operation*, to create a common basis for comparison in estimation tasks (Attari et al., 2010; Marghetis et al., 2019). For example, participants might be asked to estimate the energy used by a light bulb or a dryer operating for one hour. This laboratory definition of truth, while useful for isolating perception accuracy related to power draw, abstracts away from the real-world complexity of usage patterns (frequency, duration, mode of use), environmental factors, and standby consumption.

Other studies adopt a more ecologically valid definition of truth by measuring *actual usage* over longer periods (e.g., monthly or annually) for specific households (Chen et al., 2015; Lesic et al., 2019; Schley & DeKay, 2015). This captures the impact of behavioral patterns but makes direct comparisons across households difficult due to differing usage habits. Lesic et al. (2019) utilized direct-metered monthly data for specific devices in participants' homes, offering a ground truth that incorporates real-world use while still focusing on appliance-level consumption.

The choice of how to define and measure ground truth reflects differing conceptualizations of what constitutes "energy literacy" – is it knowledge of power draw, total consumption influenced by behavior, or relative consumption across devices? (Van Den Broek, 2019). The limitations of each method underscore the difficulty in capturing a singular, universally applicable "truth" for household energy consumption, highlighting the need for careful interpretation of findings based on the specific methodology employed (Lesic et al., 2018).

### Ground Truth Energy Consumption Estimates from Sources

The sources provide several lists of "actual" or "rawActual" energy consumption values for various household appliances, typically expressed in Watt-hours (Wh) or Watts per hour (W/hr), which are equivalent units for consumption over one hour. Some sources also provide estimates in kWh/month based on actual metered usage. It is important to note that values can vary between sources due to differing data origins (e.g., national averages vs. specific product data), years of collection, and averaging methods.

Below is a markdown table consolidating the ground truth estimates found in the provided sources. Values from Lesic et al. (2019) derived from their scatterplot figures are noted as approximate monthly averages from metered data.

As evident from the table, there are instances where different sources provide different ground truth values for the same appliance, such as the Central Air Conditioner or Laptop computer. These discrepancies underscore the variability in published data and the specific methodologies used to derive these figures. Researchers must carefully select or compute the ground truth values against which they compare participant estimates, acknowledging the potential impact of these choices on their findings (Lesic et al., 2018).

An overview of how ground truth values for energy appliance consumption are typically obtained in research studies assessing the accuracy of human estimates reveals a multi-faceted approach, contingent upon the study's objectives, resources, and desired level of granularity. These methods can be broadly categorized as follows:

1.  **Literature-Based Estimates and Databases:**
    This is a prevalent method, wherein researchers compile "actual" energy consumption figures from existing academic literature, manufacturer specifications, governmental agency reports (e.g., U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)), and databases from energy-focused organizations (e.g., Alternative Energy Store (AltE), CleanMetrics™ FoodCarbonScope™).
    * **Process:** Researchers typically gather data from multiple sources for each appliance to enhance reliability. This may involve averaging values if ranges are provided or if different sources offer slightly varying figures for similar appliances (Attari et al., 2010; Camilleri et al., 2019; Frederick et al., 2011; Marghetis et al., 2019; Van Den Broek & Walker, 2019).
    * **Considerations:** These estimates often represent an "average" or "typical" appliance within a category and may not reflect the specific model or usage pattern of an individual participant. The timeframe of data collection by the original sources is also a factor, as appliance efficiency changes over time. Frederick et al. (2011) explicitly used the values from Attari et al. (2010). Cowen & Gatersleben (2017) utilized official UK energy statistics (DECC).

2.  **Direct Measurement in Controlled or Field Settings:**
    Some studies undertake direct measurement of appliance energy consumption, which offers higher ecological validity, particularly when assessing individual participants' specific appliances.
    * **Sub-metering in Homes:** This involves installing sub-meters on individual circuits or appliances within participants' homes to capture real-time or aggregated energy use for specific devices (Chen et al., 2015; Lesic et al., 2019). Chen et al. (2015) used a commercial energy metering device installed at the circuit breaker panel, measuring current and voltage on each circuit. Lesic et al. (2019) utilized data from the Pecan Street Research Institute, where homes were equipped with electrical submeters.
    * **Lab-Based Measurement:** While less common for perception studies focused on everyday users, specific appliances could be tested under controlled laboratory conditions to determine their energy draw.
    * **Considerations:** Sub-metering provides highly accurate, household-specific data but is resource-intensive, costly, and can be intrusive, often limiting sample sizes or relying on specialized volunteer cohorts (e.g., Pecan Street). Data processing can also be complex.

3.  **Self-Reported Usage Combined with Standardized Values:**
    This approach involves collecting self-reported data from participants regarding their appliance ownership and usage patterns (e.g., frequency, duration). These self-reports are then combined with standardized energy consumption values (often from literature or manufacturer data) for those types of appliances to estimate individual or household consumption (Gatersleben et al., 2002, as cited by Lesic et al., 2018).
    * **Considerations:** While more individualized than purely literature-based estimates, this method is subject to biases in self-reporting (e.g., recall bias, social desirability).

4.  **Household-Level Meter Readings:**
    Utility company meter readings provide actual total household energy consumption.
    * **Considerations:** This method, as noted by Lesic et al. (2018), does not offer appliance-level disaggregation, making it difficult to establish ground truth for specific devices unless combined with other disaggregation techniques or when assessing overall household use perceptions. Readings may also be infrequent or estimated by utilities.

A critical aspect highlighted by Lesic et al. (2018) is the methodological variance in establishing these "actual" values, which can impact the interpretation of perception accuracy. For instance, comparing perceived use to a generic literature value versus the actual measured consumption of a participant's own appliance can lead to different conclusions about the nature and extent of misperception. Furthermore, studies like Cowen & Gatersleben (2017) sometimes standardize actual energy consumption data (e.g., on a 0-100 scale) to compare with participant estimates made on a similar relative scale, which requires careful interpretation when comparing absolute energy values.

The choice of ground truth methodology often reflects a trade-off between precision, cost, scalability, and the specific research question. Studies aiming for high-fidelity individual comparisons tend towards direct measurement, while broader surveys often rely on literature-based estimates.

Below is a table summarizing the ground truth energy consumption estimates for various appliances as found in the provided documents. It is important to note that discrepancies exist due to different data sources, appliance models, assumed usage patterns, geographical locations (e.g., US vs. UK data), and whether the value represents an average, a specific instance, or a standardized figure. Timeframes (per hour, day, month, year) are critical for interpretation.

*Note: "W" (Watts) typically implies a rate of energy consumption (power), while "Wh" (Watt-hours) is a quantity of energy consumed over an hour. In many studies asking for hourly consumption, these are used somewhat interchangeably or the "units" are tied to a 1-hour reference (e.g., 100W bulb for 1 hour = 100 units). When "per hour" is specified, W and Wh/hr are effectively equivalent. kWh/day, kWh/month, and kWh/year represent total energy over longer periods. Standardized values are relative and not directly comparable in absolute terms to Wh or kWh without knowing the standardization base.*

### Overview of Obtaining Ground Truth Energy Appliance Values in Research

Researchers in these studies obtain "ground truth" values for appliance energy consumption through several methods, each with its own strengths and limitations:

1.  **Literature Review and Publicly Available Data:**
    *   **Government Agencies & Databases:** Many studies (e.g., Attari et al., 2010; Frederick et al., 2011; Schley & DeKay, 2015; Camilleri et al., 2019) rely on data from sources like the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) (e.g., RECS survey), or similar national statistics offices (e.g., DECC in the UK, used by Cowen & Gatersleben, 2017). These often provide average energy consumption for typical appliance models or categories.
    *   **Manufacturer Specifications & Retailer Information:** Some studies gather power ratings (Watts) or typical energy use (kWh/year) from appliance labels, manufacturer websites, or retailer catalogues (e.g., Baird & Brier, 1981; Marghetis et al., 2019; Cowen & Gatersleben, 2017 for size).
    *   **Academic & Grey Literature:** Existing peer-reviewed papers, technical reports, and expert reports are consulted (e.g., Becker et al., 1979; Mettler-Meibom & Wichmann, 1982).
    *   **Methodology:** Researchers often average values from multiple sources or select a representative value if a range is provided (Camilleri et al., 2019; Kantenbacher & Attari, 2019).

2.  **Direct Measurement and Sub-metering:**
    *   **Household-Level Meter Readings:** Some older studies used utility company meter readings for overall household consumption, but this doesn't easily disaggregate to individual appliances (Kempton & Montgomery, 1982; Easton & Smith, 2010, as cited by Lesic et al., 2018).
    *   **Appliance-Level Sub-metering:** This is a more precise method where individual appliances or circuits are monitored. Chen et al. (2015) and Lesic et al. (2019) are prime examples, using high-frequency data from projects like ENGAGE or Pecan Street. This provides actual usage data for specific homes and appliances.

3.  **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Software and Databases:**
    *   For more comprehensive impacts, especially for food items which include agricultural and transport energy, researchers use LCA tools and databases (e.g., CleanMetrics FoodCarbonScope™ used by Camilleri et al., 2019). These tools estimate energy use and emissions across the product's life cycle.

4.  **Calculations Based on Power Ratings and Assumed Usage:**
    *   If power ratings (Watts) are known, energy consumption (Wh or kWh) can be calculated by assuming a typical duration of use (e.g., 1 hour for estimation tasks, or annual usage patterns for yearly estimates). Many of the psychophysical studies use this (e.g., Attari et al., 2010, where 100W bulb for 1 hr = 100 "units" of energy).

**Challenges and Considerations:**

*   **Variability:** Actual energy consumption of an appliance can vary significantly based on the specific model, its age, efficiency rating (e.g., Energy Star), user behavior (frequency and intensity of use), and environmental conditions (e.g., ambient temperature for refrigerators/ACs).
*   **"Typical" vs. "Specific":** Studies comparing perceptions to general "typical" appliance data (Attari et al., 2010) differ from those comparing perceptions to the participant's *own* metered appliance use (Lesic et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2015).
*   **Units:** Ground truth can be expressed in various units: Watts (power), Wh or kWh (energy over a period), MJ, or even percentages of total household consumption. The time frame (per hour, per day, per month, per year) is also critical.
*   **Reference Points:** Some studies provide participants with a reference appliance (e.g., a 100W incandescent bulb uses 100 units of energy in 1 hour) to anchor their estimates. The choice of this reference can impact results (Frederick et al., 2011).

In essence, the "ground truth" is often an *estimated* value itself, chosen to be representative for the study's purpose. Studies using direct sub-metering offer the most precise ground truth for the specific appliances and households being studied.

**Note on Units:**
*   **W (Watt):** Unit of power.
*   **Wh (Watt-hour):** Unit of energy (Power x Time). For appliances listed with Wh, it's typically for 1 hour of operation, so the Wh value is numerically the same as its power in Watts.
*   **kWh (Kilowatt-hour):** 1000 Wh. Often used for monthly or annual consumption.
*   **MJ (Megajoule):** Unit of energy. 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ.
*   **kg CO2e/kg:** Kilograms of CO2 equivalent emissions per kilogram of food product.

This table shows considerable variation in "ground truth" estimates across studies for similar appliances. This reflects the difficulty in establishing a single true value due to model variations, usage patterns, and different data aggregation methods by researchers.
