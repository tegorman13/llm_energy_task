Drawing on principles from cognitive psychology and group communication, research has explored various facets of individuals' understanding and engagement with household energy use and conservation behaviors. This inquiry delves into the perceived difficulty of such behaviors, the perception of appliance-level energy use, decision-making processes related to energy-saving actions, and the cognitive heuristics employed in these judgments.

Regarding the perceived difficulty of changing energy behavior or implementing energy-saving tips, the literature identifies different dimensions of cost and effort associated with energy conservation actions. Making an economically rational choice, such as selecting an energy-efficient appliance, requires performing an investment analysis considering purchase price, future operating costs, frequency of use, expected lifetime, and electricity prices, which creates "deliberation cost" or "optimization cost". This concept aligns with "bounded rationality," which posits that information acquisition and processing are cognitively burdensome, impeding optimization. Beyond monetary costs, adopting energy-efficient appliances and curtailment activities involve "hidden costs," such as time and effort, which analysts may underestimate. Transaction costs are incurred in locating appliances, finding cost information, securing retailers and installers, and understanding financial incentives like tax credits and rebates. Behavioral studies indicate that merely providing information about financial incentives is insufficient unless coupled with clear messaging about the ease of collection. Energy conservation behaviors can be costly, requiring changes to habits and investment in appliances, involving significant time and cognitive effort. Some energy-saving measures are perceived as easier than others; turning off a light is considered straightforward, while buying energy-efficient appliances and establishing habitual behaviors are perceived as more difficult. A distinction is often made between curtailment behaviors, which involve repetitive changes or reductions in existing habits (e.g., turning off lights), and efficiency behaviors, which involve one-time investments in equipment (e.g., installing double-glazed windows or buying efficient appliances). Consumers tend to prefer curtailment strategies over energy efficiency strategies, which contrasts with expert recommendations on maximizing savings. This preference may be due to curtailment actions being more cognitively accessible or coming to mind more easily than efficiency actions because they are implemented more frequently. However, low-impact curtailment behaviors, while easy to remember and perform, tend to have minimal impact on climate change compared to adopting efficient technologies.

Studies have explored perceptions of the energy usage of particular appliances, but less attention is explicitly given to measuring the perceived *difficulty* of reducing usage for specific appliances. Instead, research frequently focuses on participants' estimations of how much energy specific appliances consume and the perceived effectiveness of reducing their use (curtailment) versus replacing them with more efficient models (efficiency).

Several studies have attempted to assess how individuals perceive or classify energy-related behaviors and appliances, which can be seen as rating their attributes. The fundamental distinction between efficiency and curtailment behaviors is one such categorization based on the attribute of investment cost. Gabe-Thomas et al. (2016) found that householders categorize appliances not necessarily by energy consumption, but by activities or social practices they enable (e.g., entertainment, cooking). This suggests that mental models of energy use are often tied to the activities performed rather than just the appliance's energy-consuming properties. Studies also discuss categorizing actions by their impact level ("high-impact" vs. "low-impact").

Regarding lists of common appliance-level energy actions with accurate savings estimates, sources mention that some decision aids provide information on potential energy and cost savings for alternative energy use decisions, including switching to more efficient technologies or implementing curtailment. For example, online tools like the Home Energy Saver or EERE spreadsheet calculators are designed to help users calculate savings, though evaluating their effectiveness in influencing actual behavior is challenging. Such aids might list effective behaviors and their associated savings without providing the specific lists themselves within the reviewed sources.

Studies collecting estimates about how frequently participants use various types of appliances are less common in the provided sources compared to studies on perceived energy use. Schley and DeKay (2015) explored "cognitive accessibility," defined as the frequency with which people interact with or think about devices, and found it was used as a cue for energy consumption judgments. This concept is related to usage frequency but is operationalized as a cognitive construct influencing perception rather than a direct estimate of perceived frequency. Van Den Broek (2019) mentions participants potentially discounting the length of time appliances are used for when estimating total energy consumption.

Several studies have had participants estimate the energy usage of particular appliances:
*   Attari, DeKay, Davidson, & Bruine de Bruin (2010)
*   Baird and Brier (1981)
*   Becker (1978)
*   Chen et al. (2015)
*   Cowen & Gatersleben (2017)
*   Lesic, Bruin, Davis, Krishnamurti, & Azevedo (2018)
*   Marghetis, Attari, & Landy (2019)
*   Schley & DeKay (2015) (estimated percentage of total energy use by category, not specific appliances)
*   Schuitema & Steg (2005)

One study included a task where subjects chose the best energy reduction tip or plan:
*   Marghetis, Attari, & Landy (2019) included a Behavioral Choice Task presenting pairs of behavioral changes or activities, where participants chose the option leading to greater energy savings.

Studies that attempted to infer participant heuristics from behavior in decision-making or estimation tasks are numerous:
*   Attari, DeKay, Davidson, & Bruine de Bruin (2010) inferred availability heuristics from patterns of overestimating low-energy and underestimating high-energy activities.
*   Baird and Brier (1981) inferred the use of a size heuristic from positive correlations between perceived size and perceived energy consumption.
*   Chen et al. (2015) found misperceptions consistent with those attributed to heuristics by Attari et al. (2010).
*   Cowen & Gatersleben (2017) tested the size heuristic, finding moderate positive correlations between perceived size and energy estimates, supporting its use.
*   Lesic et al. (2018) reviewed studies finding evidence for heuristics such as availability (overestimating frequently used or thought-of appliances) and size.
*   Marghetis, Attari, & Landy (2019) explored whether interventions providing scale-use information or an explicit heuristic could improve estimations and choices in energy-saving scenarios, suggesting heuristics are relevant to both.
*   Schille-Hudson et al. (2019) investigated reliance on multiple cues (size, electronic nature, frequency of use, temperature effect) to perceive home energy use, confirming the importance of size.
*   Schley and DeKay (2015) provided evidence for the cognitive accessibility heuristic (frequency of interaction/thinking about devices) influencing energy consumption judgments, particularly for less numerate individuals.
*   Schuitema & Steg (2005) also found evidence for the size heuristic.
*   Van Den Broek (2019) and Van Den Broek & Walker (2019) specifically investigated energy judgment heuristics, identifying numerous heuristics beyond size and usage pattern, such as the heat heuristic, time-switched-on heuristic, and task size heuristic. They suggest the use of these heuristics can influence device energy literacy and potentially be changed.
*   Frederick, Meyer, & Mochon (2011) challenged prior findings, suggesting the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic influenced estimates when a reference point was provided.

While many studies measured perceived energy usage of specific appliances, the provided sources do not contain a comprehensive table with aggregated data (e.g., mean perceived Watt-hours) for various common appliances across these studies. However, the consistent finding is that people tend to overestimate the energy use of low-energy consuming appliances (e.g., light bulbs, laptops, TVs, stereos, computers) and underestimate the energy use of high-energy consuming appliances (e.g., air conditioners, clothes dryers, water heaters, heating systems). This pattern of misperception is often attributed to the use of heuristics such as availability, size, or cognitive accessibility. For instance, frequently used or thought-of appliances, or larger appliances, are perceived as consuming more energy, even if actual consumption does not follow this pattern. Curtailment actions are also overestimated in terms of potential savings compared to efficiency actions.

Drawing upon the provided sources, this response addresses inquiries concerning the perceived psychological difficulty of energy-related behaviors, the measurement of appliance usage frequency, studies involving appliance energy usage estimation, tasks requiring participants to select energy reduction strategies, efforts to infer decision-making heuristics, and the availability of aggregated data on human knowledge of appliance energy use, all while adopting the perspective of a cognitive science expert and adhering to formal APA style with comprehensive citation.

**Perceived Psychological Difficulty and Attributes of Energy-Related Behaviors**

Research in cognitive psychology and behavioral economics highlights that decisions and actions related to energy conservation are influenced not only by objective factors but also by subjective perceptions, including the perceived difficulty or cost associated with different behaviors (Frederiks et al., 2015). Several studies within the provided sources touch upon the psychological costs or perceived difficulty of various energy-saving actions.

Starke and Willemsen (2024) discuss the concept of "behavioral costs," which encompass cognitive and financial costs related to executing a behavior. They propose a "difficulty ordering" for household energy-saving behaviors, suggesting that not all actions are equally likely to be performed. This ordering is often based on how frequently a behavior is undertaken by a population, with frequently performed actions (e.g., turning off lights when leaving a room) generally perceived as having lower behavioral costs than less frequent ones (e.g., installing solar panels). Their work suggests that a person's energy-saving attitude strength is related to the range of behaviors they are likely to undertake, implying that more difficult behaviors require a stronger underlying motivation. While Starke and Willemsen (2024) derive behavioral cost proxies (δ values) from performance frequency data, this methodology infers perceived difficulty indirectly rather than directly measuring subjective ratings of psychological difficulty for each action.

Chen et al. (2017) differentiate between energy curtailment behaviors (reducing actions with existing equipment) and efficiency behaviors (investments in new, energy-efficient technologies). Curtailment behaviors are often described as requiring less upfront cost than efficiency improvements (Attari et al., 2010), suggesting a lower *perceived* financial or effort-based cost, although they may require repeated cognitive effort for habit formation (Chen et al., 2017). Borzino et al. (2025) imply that the perceived effectiveness of conservation efforts impacts sustained behavior, noting that efforts related to low-consuming appliances (like switching off lights) hardly result in noticeable savings, potentially making it less likely for individuals to maintain such efforts compared to actions with more tangible outcomes (e.g., reducing air conditioning use in a hot climate). This suggests that the perceived *impact* of a behavior can influence its psychological cost or perceived value.

Attari et al. (2010) included questions in their survey about the perceived ease or difficulty of various energy-saving behaviors. While the specifics of the rating scale or aggregated data are not detailed in the provided excerpts, this indicates that direct assessment of perceived difficulty has been a component of energy behavior research. Similarly, Schille-Hudson et al. (2019) had participants rate appliances on various "experiential features" such as how loud they are or how much they heat/cool, which can be seen as rating attributes of the *appliance's operation* rather than the *behavior* itself, but these features are often used as cues in behavioral decisions.

In summary, while some studies directly measure perceived ease/difficulty or rate experiential attributes, others infer psychological costs (behavioral costs) from observed behavior patterns, such as the frequency with which actions are performed.

**Measurement of Appliance Usage Frequency**

Direct measurement of how frequently participants use various types of appliances is mentioned as a factor influencing energy perceptions and behaviors, but detailed data or comprehensive lists of such measurements collected from participants are not extensively presented in the provided sources.

Schille-Hudson et al. (2019) included "how frequently the appliance is used" as one of the perceptual or experiential features participants were asked to rate for typical home appliances. This demonstrates that frequency of use is considered a relevant attribute in people's cognitive representation of appliances.

Attari et al. (2010) included questions about participants' energy-related habits within their demographic data collection, which might capture some aspects of appliance usage frequency or related behaviors. Li et al. (2025) found that the time spent in a dormitory was related to changes in conservation intention among students, suggesting that duration of exposure to an environment with shared appliances might influence behavior.

However, the sources do not contain aggregated data providing average estimated frequencies of use for a list of specific appliances collected directly from study participants. While frequency of use is acknowledged as a potential cue for energy estimation (Schley & DeKay, 2015, as cited in Kantenbacher & Attari, 2021, and Schille-Hudson et al., 2019), and reliance on this cue has been studied, the primary focus of the provided texts regarding frequency is on its role as a cognitive heuristic rather than on presenting aggregate usage frequency data itself.

**Studies Involving Appliance Energy Usage Estimation**

Several studies have required participants to estimate the energy consumption of specific household appliances or activities, aiming to understand public perceptions and misperceptions in this domain. These studies often reveal systematic biases in estimation.

Attari et al. (2010) conducted a study where participants estimated the energy used by nine devices and appliances and the energy saved by six household activities. A 100-Watt incandescent light bulb used for 1 hour was provided as a reference point (100 units). This study demonstrated significant, albeit imperfect, knowledge of which devices used more energy, with a mean correlation of r=0.51 between logarithmic transformations of perceived and actual energy use. A key finding was the systematic pattern of overestimates for low-energy items and underestimates for high-energy items.

Kantenbacher and Attari (2021) investigated how energy experts make judgments about household energy use, comparing their performance to that of novices (from Attari et al., 2010). Experts were asked to estimate the energy use of 17 household devices, again using a 100-Watt light bulb in 1 hour as a 100-unit reference point. Their performance was found to be more accurate than novices.

Marghetis et al. (2019) also measured participants' ability to estimate home energy use by having them estimate the electricity used in 1 hour by 36 home appliances, providing a 100W bulb reference (100 Wh). This study further confirmed the systematic error pattern where low-energy items were overestimated and high-energy items were underestimated. They investigated interventions, such as providing scale-use information or an explicit heuristic ("large appliances that primarily heat or cool use a lot more energy than people think"), finding that the heuristic specifically improved estimates for the targeted high-usage, temperature-changing appliances.

Schille-Hudson et al. (2019) also utilized an estimation task where participants estimated the energy used by 36 appliances in 1 hour, using the 100-Watt light bulb reference point. Their analysis focused on which perceptual cues (size, temperature change, electronicness, frequency of use) participants relied upon to make these estimates.

These studies collectively establish that a common methodology in understanding energy literacy involves asking individuals to estimate appliance energy consumption, often relative to a familiar reference like a light bulb.

**Studies Including Tasks for Choosing Energy Reduction Strategies or Plans**

Research has explored how individuals perceive and select energy-saving strategies or plans, highlighting preferences and cognitive biases in this decision domain.

Attari et al. (2010) initiated their study with an open-ended question asking participants for "the most effective thing that you could do to conserve energy in your life". The responses revealed a strong focus on curtailment actions (e.g., turning off lights) (55.2% of participants) over efficiency improvements (e.g., using efficient light bulbs) (11.7% of participants). This indicated a preference for easier-to-imagine, potentially lower-cost behaviors, despite efficiency actions often yielding greater energy savings.

Marghetis et al. (2019) included a "behavioral choice task" where participants were presented with pairs of activities or behavioral changes and had to select the option that would result in greater energy savings. Examples included choosing between line-drying versus using a clothes dryer or reading a book versus watching 20 hours of television. Performance on this task correlated with participants' overall understanding of appliances' relative energy use, suggesting that underlying knowledge influences strategic choices. Interventions, such as the explicit heuristic, were hypothesized to improve performance on this task by correcting underlying beliefs about appliance energy use.

Attari and Rajagopal (n.d.) discuss the existence and potential benefits of decision aids designed to help consumers make choices for energy conservation, such as Energy Star labeling or online calculators (e.g., Home Energy Saver, EERE calculators). While they advocate for developing strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of these tools, the provided excerpts do not describe a study where participants *used* or *chose among* these specific decision aids within the context of their research. Their focus is on the need for better aids and evaluating their impact.

**Studies That Attempted to Infer Participant Heuristics from Behavior in Decision-Making Tasks**

A significant body of research explores the cognitive shortcuts, or heuristics, people use when making judgments about energy consumption, particularly because energy use is often invisible and difficult to perceive directly (Chisik, 2011; Schille-Hudson et al., 2019). These heuristics can lead to systematic biases in estimation (Attari et al., 2010; Marghetis et al., 2019).

Kantenbacher and Attari (2021) explicitly sought to identify heuristics used by energy experts. Through interviews that included a talk-aloud choice task where experts determined which of two or three devices used the least energy, they analyzed verbal reports to extract cognitive shortcuts. They documented 24 unique expert heuristics, classifying them by type (function, components, observable cues). A follow-up survey asked experts to rate the accuracy of these identified expert heuristics, as well as a list of novice heuristics identified in previous work. This study directly inferred heuristics from expert thinking processes during decision tasks.

Kantenbacher and Attari (2021) reference the work of van den Broek and Walker (2019), who identified 24 novice heuristic themes and separate heuristics through thematic analysis of group discussions with undergraduate participants ranking household appliance energy use. This method inferred novice heuristics from participants' reasoning processes verbalized during a collaborative task.

Schille-Hudson et al. (2019) investigated how people integrate various cues when estimating appliance energy use. By having participants rate appliances on perceptual features (e.g., size, loudness, heating) and then estimate their energy use, they used regression analysis to determine which features (cues) predicted energy estimates. Their findings indicated that size was the primary driver of novice energy estimates, followed by temperature change and electronicness, while frequency of use did not significantly predict estimates in their model. This approach infers the *reliance* on specific features or cues as de facto heuristics by examining their statistical relationship with estimation outcomes.

Chisik (2011) observed from preliminary analysis of sketching methodology results that people lack a clear mental model of electricity and tend to associate consumption rates with the size of the device and the duration of use. While not a formal inference of explicit heuristics, this points to implicit rules (size heuristic, duration heuristic) guiding novice understanding.

Santillán and Cedano (2023) cite both van den Broek and Walker (2019) and Kantenbacher and Attari (2021) in their review, acknowledging the literature on heuristics in household energy use and expert energy experts.

These studies utilize varied methods, from verbal protocol analysis and thematic analysis of discussions to statistical modeling of estimation data, to infer the rules of thumb people employ when navigating the complex domain of energy use judgments.

**Aggregated Data on Human Knowledge of Common Appliance Energy Use**

While several studies demonstrate and describe the general patterns and inaccuracies in public perceptions of appliance energy use, the provided sources do not contain a comprehensive table presenting aggregated average estimated energy usage values for a list of common appliances by novice participants.

As noted previously, studies by Attari et al. (2010), Kantenbacher and Attari (2021), Marghetis et al. (2019), and Schille-Hudson et al. (2019) involved participants estimating appliance energy use. These studies consistently report key findings about the nature of these estimations:

*   **Systematic Bias:** Novice estimates show a consistent pattern of overestimating the energy use of low-consumption appliances and underestimating the energy use of high-consumption appliances (Attari et al., 2010; Marghetis et al., 2019). This results in a compressed mental scale of energy usage compared to reality.
*   **Correlation with Actual Use:** Despite the biases, participants demonstrate some significant knowledge of the relative ordering of appliances by energy use, as indicated by positive correlations between perceived and actual energy use values (Attari et al., 2010 reported r=0.51 on a logarithmic scale; Marghetis et al., 2019 also found correlations). Individual differences in this understanding of relative order predict conservation behaviors.
*   **Influence of Cues/Heuristics:** Estimates are strongly influenced by readily available perceptual cues. Schille-Hudson et al. (2019) found appliance size to be the primary predictor of novice energy estimates, with lesser reliance on temperature change and electronicness. Reliance on temperature change was associated with better estimation accuracy, while reliance on size, electronicness, or frequency of use was associated with worse accuracy.

While these sources describe the nature of human understanding and misunderstanding of appliance energy use and the factors influencing estimates, they do not compile a table listing specific appliances alongside their actual energy use and the average perceived energy use reported by participant groups. Kantenbacher and Attari (2021) provide actual wattage values for pairs of appliances used in their expert choice task but not novice estimates. Therefore, based on the provided excerpts, I cannot furnish aggregated data on average novice estimations for specific appliances like dishwashers or ceiling fans. The key insights are the systematic biases and the role of perceptual cues in driving these estimations.

**Perceived and Psychological Difficulty of Energy Behaviors, and Attribute Ratings**

Research indicates that altering household energy consumption involves psychological considerations beyond simply lacking factual information. Consumers often face "other costs" when attempting to reduce energy use, such as the time, effort, and potential sacrifices in comfort associated with curtailment behaviors. Similarly, adopting energy-efficient technologies can involve "hidden costs" or "transaction costs," including the time and monetary expenditure required to research options, locate retailers, and arrange installation.

Studies have explored the cognitive burden associated with energy-related decisions. For instance, calculating the lifetime cost of electrical appliances, which is necessary for making an economically rational choice, creates "deliberation cost," "decision-making cost," or "optimization cost". This concept aligns with bounded rationality, suggesting that processing complex information like energy data can be cognitively demanding, impeding optimal decision-making. Interventions like online calculators are being explored to potentially minimize this cognitive effort.

Regarding the perceived difficulty of specific actions, turning off lights is noted as being "rather straightforward". In contrast, purchasing energy-efficient appliances and establishing new energy-saving habits are perceived as more challenging. This aligns with a common distinction in the literature between curtailment behaviors (repetitive actions like turning off lights) and efficiency behaviors (one-time investments like buying new appliances). Although curtailment typically involves less monetary cost than efficiency improvements, it requires behavioral changes and often involves non-monetary costs like time and effort.

Some studies have measured participants' perceptions regarding the ease or difficulty of performing energy-saving behaviors. For example, Attari et al. (2010) included "Perceived Ease/Difficulty of Energy-Saving Behaviors" as a construct in their survey. This suggests that the subjective experience of engaging in conservation actions is considered relevant in understanding energy behavior.

While sources mention rating *appliance* attributes like size, frequency of use, and heat generated, they do not explicitly detail studies where participants rated a broad range of *behavioral* attributes for various energy-saving actions beyond perceived ease/difficulty. However, research does classify behaviors based on attributes like investment cost (curtailment vs. efficiency) and explores which behaviors are more or less likely to be performed. The Starke et al. (2020) study used a scale consisting of 79 energy-saving measures for advice tailoring, which suggests a structured approach to categorizing and potentially evaluating different actions, although the specific attributes rated by participants are not detailed in the excerpt.

**Lists of Common Appliance-Level Energy Actions with Accurate Savings Estimates**

Sources highlight that consumers often lack accurate information about the energy consumption of specific appliances and the potential savings associated with various strategies. Public perceptions frequently contrast with expert recommendations, with people tending to underestimate the energy savings from efficiency improvements (e.g., replacing incandescent bulbs with LEDs) while overestimating the impact of curtailment actions (e.g., turning off lights). This suggests that even when people consider lists of actions, their understanding of the associated savings is often inaccurate.

Decision aids can provide lists of recommended behaviors. Some aids offer general tips without specific effectiveness or cost information, while others focus on efficiency technologies and provide potential energy and cost savings. For example, online calculators help users evaluate savings for efficiency upgrades.

One study included a task where participants chose between pairs of behavioral changes to identify which would result in greater energy savings. Accuracy in the control group was poor, indicating a lack of knowledge about relative savings. While this task involved choosing between actions, it does not explicitly state that participants were *provided* with accurate savings estimates as part of the intervention or task design.

The sources reference frameworks that list numerous energy-saving measures, such as the 79 measures used in the Starke et al. (2020) study. Table 1 in Starke & Willemsen (2024) provides a non-exhaustive list of 44 such measures, some tied to specific appliances (e.g., "Use LED lighting," "Use a smart thermostat"). However, this list does not include accurate energy savings estimates for each item in the context of the provided excerpts. The focus in these sources is more on classifying behaviors (e.g., efficiency vs. curtailment) and assessing the effectiveness of interventions or decision aids related to these actions.

**Studies that Collected Estimates about How Frequently Participants Use Various Types of Appliances**

While some studies explore the *perception* of usage frequency as a heuristic cue for estimating energy consumption, they do not necessarily collect participants' quantitative estimates of actual usage frequency for various appliances. Schley and DeKay (2015) investigated the role of "cognitive accessibility," defined as the frequency with which people interact with or think about devices, inferring its use based on correlations with energy estimates. Schille-Hudson et al. (2019) had participants rate appliances on features including "frequency of use," but this was a subjective rating of the perceived attribute, not an estimate of actual usage duration or frequency.

Some studies that used self-reported behaviors to estimate energy use or provide tailored feedback would have implicitly gathered information about appliance usage patterns, which could include frequency or duration. For example, Abrahamse et al. (2007) collected self-reported behaviors to calculate energy use and tailor information about energy-saving options. However, this was used for calculation and feedback, not presented as participants' direct *estimates* of their usage frequency. Lesic et al. (2019) asked participants to estimate energy consumption for an average summer month, which would require individuals to implicitly consider their usage frequency and duration over that period, though they reported a total consumption figure, not the frequency estimate itself.

Studies on heuristics mention that perceived energy use is larger for appliances used more often (Schley & DeKay, 2015), and people may misestimate the amount of time they spend on tasks, potentially overestimating energy use for appliances they use longer. This body of work acknowledges that people have some internal sense of usage frequency, which they may use in judgments, but does not detail studies explicitly collecting participants' quantitative estimates of appliance usage frequency across a range of devices.

**Studies Where Participants Estimated Energy Usage of Particular Appliances**

Multiple studies have engaged participants in estimating the energy consumption of specific household appliances. These studies often reveal systematic inaccuracies in public perception.

Studies that have had participants estimate the energy usage of particular appliances include:

1.  Attari, DeKay, Davidson, & Bruine De Bruin (2010). Participants estimated the energy use of nine household appliances relative to a 100W incandescent light bulb.
2.  Baird and Brier (1981). Participants estimated the size and energy consumption of a set of household appliances. A quantitative study using a ranking methodology also found participants were good at estimating energy use by ranking.
3.  Schuitema and Steg (2005). Participants estimated the size and energy consumption of a set of household appliances.
4.  Lesic, de Bruin, Davis, Krishnamurti, & Azevedo (2019). Homeowners estimated the energy consumption of six monitored devices in their homes.
5.  Marghetis, Attari, & Landy (2019). Participants estimated Watt-hours for 1 hour of use for 36 appliances, using a 100W bulb as a reference.
6.  Cowen & Gatersleben (2017). Participants estimated the size and energy consumption of household appliances to re-test the size heuristic.
7.  Schille-Hudson, Margehtis, Miniard, Landy, & Attari (2019). Participants made energy estimates for multiple home appliances using a 100-watt light bulb as a reference point.

It is worth noting that while some studies like Schley & DeKay (2015) asked for estimates of energy use, they focused on percentages for *categories* of devices rather than absolute estimates for individual appliances, distinguishing their method from studies like Attari et al. (2010). Other studies mention poor public understanding of appliance energy use based on this body of research.

**Studies Which Included a Task Where Subjects Chose the Best Energy Reduction Tip or Plan**

Several studies included tasks where participants made choices related to energy reduction or efficient technologies.

Studies that included a choice task concerning energy reduction or efficiency decisions include:

1.  Marghetis, Attari, & Landy (2019). Included a Behavioral Choice Task (BCT) where participants selected the option leading to greater energy savings between pairs of behavioral changes or activities.
2.  Attari, DeKay, Davidson, & Bruine De Bruin (2010). Asked participants to indicate the most effective thing they could do to conserve energy.
3.  Blasch, Filippini, & Kumar (2019). Had participants determine which of two similar appliances minimizes lifetime cost, which involves choosing the most cost-efficient option.
4.  Blasch et al. (2022). Analyzed whether interventions could increase an individual's ability to identify the electrical appliance with the lower lifetime cost when confronted with a choice between two appliances.

These studies focused on different types of choices, ranging from selecting perceived effective behaviors or tips to identifying the most cost-efficient appliance in a purchase scenario.

**Studies That Attempted to Infer Participant Heuristics From Behavior in Decision Making Tasks**

Psychological research suggests that individuals frequently use heuristics, or simple rules, to simplify complex judgments, including those about household energy consumption. Several studies have attempted to identify and understand the heuristics people employ in making energy judgments, often inferring their use from participants' responses or decision patterns.

Studies that attempted to infer participant heuristics include:

1.  Cowen & Gatersleben (2017). Re-tested the use of the "size heuristic," inferring its use by correlating participants' perceptions of appliance size with their perceptions of energy consumption.
2.  Attari, DeKay, Davidson, & Bruine De Bruin (2010). The pattern of participants' energy estimates (overestimating low-use, underestimating high-use) and their tendency to prioritize curtailment led researchers to suggest the influence of the "availability heuristic" and "anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic". The use of a 100W bulb as a reference point was particularly linked to anchoring effects.
3.  Baird and Brier (1981). Observed participants using the physical size of appliances as a proxy for energy consumption, inferring the use of a size heuristic from correlated estimates and patterns of errors (overestimating large, underestimating small).
4.  Schley & DeKay (2015). Investigated "cognitive accessibility" (frequency of interaction/thinking) as a potential heuristic, inferring its use from correlations between accessibility ratings and estimated energy consumption, suggesting participants substitute an easier judgment (accessibility) for a harder one (energy use).
5.  Van Den Broek & Walker (2019). Used mixed methods, including qualitative mapping of heuristics used during group discussions while ranking appliances, and surveys asking about awareness of heuristics. While not strictly inferring from a decision *task* behavior in all cases, they explored heuristics influencing judgments.
6.  Schille-Hudson et al. (2019). Investigated reliance on various perceptual cues (size, "electronic"-ness, frequency, temperature change) as potential heuristics, using regression analysis to determine how these rated features predicted energy estimates, thus inferring the relative "cue-weighting" or reliance on these attributes.
7.  Lesic, de Bruin, Davis, Krishnamurti, & Azevedo (2019). Similar to Attari et al. (2010), inferred the use of an anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic based on the pattern of estimation inaccuracies relative to the reference point used.
8.  Blasch, Filippini, & Kumar (2019). Inferred the use of heuristics (e.g., relying on purchase price or energy label rating) when participants did not perform calculations to determine the appliance with the lowest lifetime cost, contrasting this with an optimization strategy.

These studies use different methodologies, including correlating perceptual ratings and estimates, analyzing patterns of estimation errors relative to reference points, observing discussion during ranking tasks, analyzing how subjective ratings predict estimates, and observing whether calculation or simpler rules guide choice behavior.

**Full or Aggregated Data on Human Knowledge of Common Appliance Energy Use**

While several sources discuss studies that collected participants' estimates of the energy use of common household appliances, none of the provided excerpts contain a table or a comprehensive aggregated dataset summarizing the *average* human estimates for specific appliances (e.g., dishwasher, ceiling fan, etc.) compared to actual energy use.

The sources describe the *findings* from these studies, such as the general pattern that low-energy consuming appliances tend to be overestimated, while high-energy consuming appliances are underestimated. They discuss the methodologies used (e.g., using a 100W bulb as a reference, estimating Wh or kWh/month, ranking) and the factors influencing accuracy (e.g., numeracy, environmental attitudes, heuristics). However, the raw or calculated average numerical estimates for specific appliances across participants are not presented in the provided text excerpts. Therefore, a table compiling this specific data cannot be generated solely based on the information available in these sources.

Understanding household energy consumption and promoting conservation presents significant challenges, often rooted in cognitive processes, perception, and decision-making. As an expert in cognitive psychology, I can address your queries based on the provided sources, detailing the research on individuals' understanding and perceptions of energy use and conservation behaviors.

### Perceived Difficulty and Costs of Energy-Saving Behaviors

Research in cognitive and environmental psychology highlights that engaging in energy-saving behaviors involves perceived costs and difficulties that influence individuals' decisions. While monetary costs are evident, particularly for energy efficiency investments, behaviors also carry non-monetary burdens often referred to as behavioral costs. These costs encompass the time, effort, cognitive load, and potential sacrifices in comfort associated with adopting or changing behaviors.

Energy conservation actions can be broadly categorized into **curtailment** and **efficiency** measures. Curtailment involves repetitive changes in daily habits or reducing the frequency/duration of activities without changing technology, such as turning off lights or taking shorter showers. Efficiency involves one-time investments in more energy-efficient technologies, such as upgrading appliances or improving home insulation.

Studies indicate that householders perceive varying levels of difficulty associated with these behaviors. Turning off a light, for instance, is generally considered "rather straightforward". In contrast, behaviors like purchasing energy-efficient appliances or forming new energy-saving habits are often perceived as more difficult.

The complexity of energy decisions also contributes to perceived difficulty. Consumers face a "staggering array" of options for reducing their energy footprint, whether through curtailment or efficiency upgrades. Evaluating these options involves understanding the trade-offs, which can be cognitively burdensome. The process of calculating the potential lifetime cost of an appliance, for example, requires considerable time and cognitive effort (referred to as "deliberation cost," "decision-making cost," or "optimization cost"), particularly for individuals with lower energy or investment literacy. This cognitive burden contributes to bounded rationality, where individuals may rely on simpler decision strategies rather than full optimization.

Furthermore, adopting energy-efficient technologies or changing routines can involve "hidden costs" not immediately apparent to an analyst, such as the time and money required to research options, find retailers or installers (transaction costs), or a perceived reduction in service quality. Studies exploring consumer preferences for energy efficiency often reveal that householders are sensitive to the upfront costs of investments and the time horizon for realizing savings, highlighting the perceived financial burden.

While the sources describe these concepts and the cognitive challenges involved in energy decisions, they do not include studies that explicitly ask participants to rate or measure the perceived psychological difficulty of a broad list of energy-saving tips or appliance-level actions in a standardized way, beyond the general distinction between curtailment and efficiency and observations about the relative ease of simple actions like turning off lights. However, research on decision-making processes and the influence of behavioral costs supports the notion that these factors play a crucial role in adopting energy-saving behaviors.

### Appliance Usage Frequency Estimates

The provided sources offer limited information regarding studies that have specifically collected *estimates from participants* about how frequently they use various types of appliances.

Some studies utilized self-reported behaviors to assess energy use or the impact of interventions. For instance, one study needed self-reported behaviors about current practices to provide tailored information about energy-saving options. However, these sources do not detail whether participants were asked to provide quantitative estimates of appliance usage frequency (e.g., hours per week, cycles per month) for a range of specific appliances. The discussion often focuses on using self-report measures to estimate *energy use* rather than directly quantify *frequency*.

One source mentions that in studies exploring heuristics, participants sometimes judged appliance energy use based on the frequency with which they interacted with or thought about devices, a concept termed cognitive accessibility (Schley & DeKay, 2015). This line of research suggests that frequency of interaction is used as a *cue* or *heuristic* to estimate energy consumption, but it does not indicate that participants were asked to provide quantitative *estimates of their own usage frequency* for a list of appliances.

The survey description in one source lists specific questions about self-reported frequency for a limited set of energy-related activities, such as "How many times a week do you shower with hot water?" and "How long are your showers in minutes?". It also asks about the percentage of energy-efficient light bulbs in the home. However, it does not include questions asking participants to estimate the usage frequency of common appliances like clothes dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, or televisions.

Therefore, while self-reported *behaviors* were used in some studies, and frequency of interaction is considered a heuristic cue, the sources do not indicate the existence of studies collecting extensive participant *estimates* of the usage frequency for a wide range of specific household appliances.

### Studies Where Participants Estimated Energy Usage of Particular Appliances

Several studies have investigated individuals' perceptions and estimations of the energy consumed by household appliances. This body of research consistently finds that people often have inaccurate perceptions of appliance energy use.

Key studies that included tasks where participants estimated the energy usage of specific appliances include:

1.  **Attari, DeKay, Davidson, and Bruine de Bruin (2010):** Participants in an online survey were asked to estimate the energy used by nine household appliances. In this study, participants were provided with a reference point, specifically that a 100-watt incandescent light bulb uses 100 units of energy in one hour, and were asked to estimate the energy units used in one hour by other appliances. The findings revealed systematic inaccuracies, with participants tending to overestimate energy use for low-energy items (like light bulbs and laptops) and significantly underestimate it for high-energy items (like air conditioners and dryers). This pattern of misestimation was attributed, in part, to cognitive biases like the availability heuristic and anchoring-and-adjustment. Participants also showed a compression bias, underestimating the large differences between high and low consumption activities.
2.  **Marghetis, Attari, and Landy (2019):** This experimental study included an estimation task where participants estimated the Watt-hours (Wh) used for 1 hour of use for 36 different appliances, using a 100W bulb as a reference. The study examined whether simple interventions (providing scale-use information or an explicit heuristic) could improve these estimations.
3.  **Baird and Brier (1981):** These laboratory experiments involved participants estimating the size and energy consumption of a set of household appliances. They found positive correlations between perceived size and perceived energy consumption, suggesting the use of a size heuristic. Their observations of estimation errors (overestimating large, underestimating small) further supported this. While they also used ranking methods, they collected absolute estimations.
4.  **Schuitema and Steg (2005):** Similar to Baird and Brier (1981), this study asked participants to estimate the size and energy consumption of household appliances and found positive correlations, although with a smaller effect size. They also observed errors consistent with a size heuristic.
5.  **Schley and DeKay (2015):** While primarily focusing on *categories* of devices rather than individual appliances, this study had participants estimate the percentages of total annual energy consumed by various end-use categories (e.g., lighting, cooking). This required participants to judge the relative energy impact of different activities, which is related to understanding appliance energy use. The study explored the role of cognitive accessibility (how often devices are interacted with or thought about) as a cue for these estimations.
6.  **Chen et al. (2015):** This study compared surveyed energy consumption estimates for appliance *categories* (heating/cooling, plug load, lighting) to measured consumption from participants' homes, finding misperceptions similar to those reported by Attari et al. (2010). While not strictly individual appliance estimates, it involved estimates at a more granular level than total household energy.

Other studies have used ranking methodologies, where participants order appliances by perceived energy consumption, often finding better accuracy in relative ranking compared to absolute estimation. Qualitative studies using interviews and drawing methods also explored individuals' knowledge and perceptions of appliance energy use.

Methodological variations, such as the use of different reference points, units (e.g., kWh vs. monetary units), and time periods (e.g., hourly vs. annual consumption), have been shown to influence reported perceptions and accuracy. The accuracy of perceptions is often evaluated by comparing participant estimates to expert estimates, measured aggregate household use, or appliance-level metering data.

### Studies Including a Task Where Subjects Chose the Best Energy Reduction Tip or Plan

Several studies have included tasks where participants made choices related to energy conservation, evaluating their ability to select the most effective strategy or option.

1.  **Marghetis, Attari, and Landy (2019):** This study included a "Behavioral Choice Task" (BCT) where participants made 20 pairwise choices about energy use and savings. For each pair, participants had to choose the task or appliance that used the least amount of electricity or the action that would lead to greater energy savings. Examples included choosing between watching a movie on a laptop vs. a projector, warming oneself with an electric blanket vs. a portable space heater, or actions like line drying clothes vs. using a clothes dryer. The study found that accuracy on this task was poor in the control condition and was related to participants' ability to accurately estimate the energy use of the relevant appliances and their understanding of relative energy use.
2.  **Studies using Stated Preference Methods:** Newell and Siikamäki (2014) review studies that employed stated preference methods, such as choice experiments or conjoint analysis, to explore consumers' decisions regarding energy-using durable goods or residential energy efficiency improvements. These studies presented participants with hypothetical choices between options (e.g., different appliances, renovation projects) that varied in attributes like upfront cost, energy savings, environmental benefits, and comfort. Participants' choices were analyzed to understand their preferences and willingness to pay for energy-saving features. Examples include work by Banfi et al. (2008), Alberini, Banfi, & Ramseier (2013), Wasi & Carson (2013), Farsi (2010), and Michelson & Madlener (2012).
3.  **Blasch et al. (2019, 2022):** These studies examined appliance choice decisions. Participants were presented with two similar appliances and asked to determine which minimized lifetime cost, essentially choosing the most economically rational option. These studies investigated the impact of information display (monetary vs. physical units) and energy/investment literacy on participants' ability to make this optimal choice. They found that displaying information in monetary terms and higher cognitive skills increased the likelihood of identifying the most cost-efficient appliance, suggesting that individuals either optimize or use heuristics based on available information and abilities.

These studies demonstrate different approaches to assessing individuals' ability to make informed energy-related choices, ranging from selecting between specific actions/appliances based on energy use to choosing between hypothetical efficiency investments with varying costs and benefits.

### Studies That Attempted to Infer Participant Heuristics from Behavior in Decision-Making Tasks

A significant portion of the research on energy perception and judgment has focused on identifying the cognitive heuristics that individuals employ to simplify complex decisions about energy use. Heuristics are simple rules or mental shortcuts that allow for quick decision-making but can lead to systematic biases and inaccuracies. Studies infer the use of heuristics by observing patterns in participants' judgments, estimations, and choices, particularly when these deviate predictably from objective reality or rational calculation.

Studies that have attempted to infer participant heuristics from their behavior include:

1.  **Attari, DeKay, Davidson, and Bruine de Bruin (2010):** Based on the pattern of overestimating low-energy and underestimating high-energy activities, and the compression of estimates, the authors inferred the use of the **availability heuristic** (where judgments are based on the ease with which examples come to mind, leading to overestimation of salient but low-impact activities like turning off lights) and the **anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic** (where estimates are anchored to a given reference point and insufficiently adjusted). The use of a 100W light bulb as a reference in the estimation task appeared to act as an anchor.
2.  **Baird and Brier (1981), Schuitema and Steg (2005), Chisik (2011), Cowen and Gatersleben (2017), and van den Broek (2016):** These studies inferred the use of the **size heuristic**, where people judge an appliance's energy consumption based on its physical size. This was inferred from positive correlations between participants' perceived size and perceived energy consumption, and from errors where large, inefficient appliances were overestimated and small, high-energy ones were underestimated. Cowen and Gatersleben (2017) specifically re-tested this heuristic.
3.  **Schley and DeKay (2015):** This research inferred the use of a **cognitive accessibility heuristic**, where individuals use the frequency with which they interact with or think about devices as a cue for their energy consumption. This was inferred from correlations between participants' self-reported accessibility of device categories and their estimated energy consumption percentages. Participants seemed to overuse this cue relative to its actual predictive validity.
4.  **Van Den Broek and Walker (2019):** This work systematically investigated energy judgment heuristics using mixed methods. Study 1 qualitatively identified 24 different heuristics used by participants during a group ranking task, significantly more than previously documented (including size, task, time switched on, and heat heuristics). These heuristics were inferred from the participants' verbal justifications and discussions about their energy judgments. Study 2 assessed participants' awareness of these heuristics. Study 3 explored whether providing information about the validity of certain heuristics (e.g., heat is often a valid cue, while time switched on might not be for peak power) could change their use and improve energy literacy.
5.  **Blasch et al. (2019, 2022):** These studies on appliance choice inferred that consumers who did not perform investment calculations when choosing between appliances with different lifetime costs were likely relying on heuristic decision-making based on salient characteristics (like low purchase price or energy efficiency rating), rather than optimizing. This was inferred by comparing the decision strategies reported or implied by participants' choices to the economically rational calculation and considering their cognitive abilities (literacy).

These studies collectively demonstrate that individuals employ a variety of heuristics when making energy judgments, and researchers have developed methodologies to infer these heuristics by analyzing estimation patterns, stated justifications, and choices in controlled tasks.

### Full or Aggregated Data on Human Knowledge of Common Appliance Energy Use

Based on the provided sources, a comprehensive, aggregated dataset presenting human knowledge (e.g., mean estimates, standard deviations) for the energy use of a wide range of common appliances across multiple studies is not directly available. However, the sources consistently report on the *nature and general findings* regarding the accuracy of human perceptions:

*   **General Inaccuracy:** People consistently mis-estimate the energy consumption of home appliances. Their understanding is often described as poor.
*   **Overestimation of Low-Use / Underestimation of High-Use:** A robust finding is the tendency to overestimate the energy used by low-energy consuming appliances and underestimate the energy used by high-energy consuming appliances. This contributes to a "compression bias" where people underestimate the significant differences in energy use between various appliances and activities.
*   **Magnitude of Misperception:** One source, referencing Attari et al. (2010), states that the public underestimates energy use and savings by an average factor of 2.8, with significant underestimations for high-energy activities and slight overestimations for low-energy ones.
*   **Relative vs. Absolute Accuracy:** While absolute estimates for single appliances are often poor, some studies suggest people are relatively good at ranking appliances by their energy use.
*   **Influence of Methodologies:** The reported perceptions and accuracy can be affected by methodological choices, such as the specific reference points provided, the units used for reporting estimates (e.g., kWh vs. monetary units), and the time periods considered (e.g., hourly vs. annual).
*   **Influence of Individual Differences:** Accuracy appears somewhat associated with individual differences, such as higher numeracy and stronger pro-environmental attitudes.

While a central repository of all participant estimates is not included, Source provides a list of 36 appliances and energy-related activities with their *correct* energy consumption values (in Watt-hours for a specified duration, typically one hour) that were used as the objective measure in the Marghetis, Attari, and Landy (2019) study. This list represents the target knowledge that participants in that study were asked to estimate. Examples from this list include:

*   100-watt Incandescent light bulb: 100 Wh
*   CFL bulb: 23 Wh
*   LED light bulb: 15 Wh
*   Laptop computer: 32 Wh
*   Desktop computer: 138 Wh (tower: 92 Wh, monitor: 34 Wh)
*   40” flat screen television: 68 Wh
*   Window air conditioner: 1157 Wh
*   Central air conditioner: 3797 Wh (per hour, or 30376 Wh for 8 hours in a BCT scenario)
*   Clothes dryer: 3938 Wh (per use)
*   Dishwasher: 1201 Wh (per use)
*   Electric oven: 3050 Wh (per hour)
*   Water heater: 4284 Wh (per hour at full capacity)
*   Charging a Tesla Model-S electric car: 11520 Wh (for one hour)

This list provides objective energy usage data used in one specific study's estimation and choice tasks, illustrating the range of values involved and the information participants were asked to judge. However, the actual *participant estimates* for these items are not presented in the provided sources.

### Lists of Common Appliance-Level Energy Actions with Accurate Savings Estimates

The sources discuss various energy-saving actions at the appliance level, primarily distinguishing between curtailment and efficiency measures. While they mention the *need* for consumers to understand the energy savings associated with specific strategies, they do not provide a general, comprehensive list of common appliance-level actions paired with standardized, accurate savings estimates.

The discussion of decision aids highlights their purpose in helping consumers identify potentially effective behaviors and calculate savings for efficiency upgrades. Examples of behaviors mentioned include:

*   Curtailment: Turning off lights, taking shorter showers, unplugging devices, changing computer sleep settings, reducing frequency/duration of appliance use.
*   Efficiency: Replacing incandescent bulbs with LEDs, installing low-flow toilets, insulating the home, buying energy-efficient appliances (e.g., Energy Star refrigerator, A+ freezer), investing in solar or storage.

The Marghetis, Attari, and Landy (2019) study's Behavioral Choice Task implicitly provides some information on relative savings by presenting pairs of actions and asking which saves more energy. The underlying energy values for these pairs are listed, allowing for the calculation of the energy difference between the two options in that specific scenario (e.g., line drying versus using a clothes dryer results in a saving of 3938 Wh per week based on the dryer's usage value in that task). However, this does not constitute a general list of actions with universal savings estimates, as savings can vary based on appliance model, usage patterns, and context.

Overall, while the literature recognizes that consumers often lack accurate information about the potential savings from specific energy-saving actions, the provided sources do not contain a compiled list of common appliance-level behaviors and their associated accurate savings estimates. Instead, they describe the *types* of actions studied and the methods used to assess perceptions of savings or the effectiveness of interventions promoting these actions.

Based on the provided sources, research has explored various aspects of cognitive processing, perception, and decision-making related to household energy use. Several studies address the psychological dimensions of energy conservation behaviors and perceptions of energy consumption, though direct measures of *perceived psychological difficulty* for specific actions are less common than assessments of knowledge, perceptions of effectiveness, or behavioral antecedents like perceived behavioral control.

**Perceived Psychological Difficulty and Behavioral Attributes**

Research indicates that adopting energy conservation behaviors involves perceived costs beyond monetary expenditure, such as time, effort, and potential sacrifices in comfort. While the sources do not explicitly list studies that use a standardized scale to rate the *psychological difficulty* of specific actions, they discuss constructs that relate to this concept.

*   Studies on household energy use frequently categorize strategies into efficiency improvements (typically one-time decisions like appliance purchase) and curtailment behaviors (repeated decisions involving reducing frequency or duration of use). Curtailment, while often not involving monetary cost, incurs costs related to time, effort, and comfort. This implies a perceived psychological cost associated with repeated behavioral adjustment.
*   Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), a construct within the Theory of Planned Behavior, assesses the perceived ease or difficulty of performing a behavior and the belief in one's ability to control that behavior. Scales measuring PBC related to energy saving are mentioned as validated psychological measures for predicting energy-saving behavior. Habibi Asgarabad et al. (2024) specifically measured perceived difficulty related to electricity saving behavior in their study protocol. Self-efficacy, the belief in one's capability to successfully perform conservation actions, is also mentioned as a relevant measure, assessing how individuals feel about their capacity for conservation, which is linked to perceived difficulty.
*   Studies exploring public perceptions of energy use reveal biases in how people *perceive the effectiveness* of different strategies. People tend to believe that curtailment behaviors (e.g., turning off lights, shorter showers) are among the most effective ways to decrease resource use, contrasting with expert recommendations that highlight the greater impact of efficiency improvements. This suggests that perceived effectiveness is an attribute individuals consider, and their judgments may be systematically inaccurate. This misperception of effectiveness could be related to the salience or perceived simplicity (and perhaps lower perceived difficulty) of curtailment actions compared to the complexity and upfront cost associated with efficiency investments.
*   Marghetis et al. (2019) included a Behavioral Choice Task where participants selected between pairs of behavioral changes or activities to identify which would lead to greater energy savings, effectively rating perceived effectiveness through pairwise comparison. Accuracy in this task was poor in the control condition.
*   Research has also explored how individuals weigh attributes like perceived effort and impact when considering energy-saving tips or strategies. While specific studies are not detailed, this suggests that behavioral attributes like effort and impact are dimensions along which energy actions are evaluated.

**Lists of Common Appliance-Level Energy Actions with Accurate Savings Estimates**

While specific, exhaustive lists of energy-saving tips with detailed, accurate savings estimates are not fully reproduced in the provided sources as standalone documents, the literature describes studies where such information was used or where misperceptions about savings were measured.

*   Attari et al. (2010) asked participants to estimate the energy saved by various conservation actions, revealing widespread misperceptions, such as overestimating savings from low-impact curtailment actions (e.g., turning off lights) and underestimating high-impact efficiency improvements. This seminal study used tables of actual energy values for comparison to assess the accuracy of participant estimates.
*   Marghetis et al. (2019) tested interventions aimed at correcting misperceptions of home energy use. While the interventions themselves involved numerical information and heuristics rather than a list of tips, the study context implies an underlying understanding of energy-saving actions.
*   Chen et al. (2024), mentioned in the bibliography, provided participants with energy-saving tips based on research or utilities, and themes of these tips are listed (e.g., behavioral strategies, efficiency strategies). The full lists or associated accurate savings estimates are not provided in the excerpts, requiring consultation of the full papers.
*   The concept of providing "Energy-Impact Transparency" by showing quantified energy, environmental, or cost impacts alongside suggested actions is discussed as a potential manipulation to steer users towards higher-leverage strategies. This implies that such quantified estimates exist and could be presented.

**Appliance Usage Frequency Estimates**

The provided sources frequently discuss the *perception* of appliance usage frequency as a heuristic used by individuals when estimating energy consumption. However, they do not explicitly detail studies that collected *estimates* from participants about how frequently they use a range of common appliances.

*   Schley and DeKay (2015) found that participants' estimated energy use was larger for appliances that were used more often, suggesting frequency perception influences energy judgments. Appliances interacted with more frequently were perceived as consuming more energy.
*   Van Den Broek (2019) notes that survey respondents tended to underestimate long-use appliances like fridges, suggesting they may have discounted the length of time appliances are used when judging total energy consumption. The "time-switched-on heuristic" is identified as one of the heuristics people use, where devices switched on for longer are thought to consume low levels of energy per minute.
*   Van Den Broek (2019) also highlights methodological issues in measuring device energy literacy, noting some studies disregard frequency and length of use, while others assess contribution to the bill, thereby incorporating use time. The paper acknowledges that appliance interaction and use vary greatly across individuals.
*   Schille-Hudson et al. (n.d.) identified typical usage duration as a significant predictor people rely on when estimating home energy use.

While these sources confirm that the *perception* of usage frequency is relevant to energy judgments and varies among individuals, they do not describe studies where participants were specifically asked to provide quantitative estimates of their own typical frequency of use for a standard set of appliances.

**Studies Having Participants Estimate Energy Usage of Particular Appliances**

Numerous studies have employed tasks where participants estimate the energy consumption of specific household appliances or activities. These studies have been crucial in identifying common misperceptions and the heuristics underlying them.

*   Attari et al. (2010) conducted a seminal survey where participants estimated the energy used by nine common household appliances (light bulbs, laptops, stereos, desktop computers, room air conditioners, space heaters, dishwashers, central air conditioners, and electric clothes dryers) and the energy saved by various conservation actions, relative to a reference point (a 100W incandescent bulb). The full survey materials and tables of actual energy values are reported to be available in the supplementary materials.
*   Marghetis et al. (2019) also used an energy use estimation task, similar to Attari et al. (2010), asking participants to estimate the Watt-hours for 1 hour of use for 36 appliances, referenced to a 100W bulb.
*   Early studies assessed device energy literacy by having participants rank household devices by energy consumption. Baird and Brier (1981) used a ranking methodology and also quantitative estimates, finding strong correlations between perceived size and energy consumption.
*   Schuitema and Steg (2005) also conducted quantitative studies examining the correlation between perceived size and energy estimates.
*   Cowen and Gatersleben (2017) re-tested the use of the size heuristic, measuring participants' perceptions of size and energy consumption.
*   Chisik (2011) and Kempton and Montgomery (1982) are cited as early studies revealing that people have a poor understanding of appliance energy use, likely involving estimation tasks or qualitative methods.
*   Mettler-Meibom and Wichmann (1982) are also noted for suggesting poor understanding of appliance electricity use.
*   Schley and DeKay (2015) conducted studies where participants estimated the *percentages* of total annual household energy used for various end-use categories (e.g., clothes washing/drying, heating/cooling) rather than hourly estimates for individual devices.
*   Lesic et al. (2018) reviewed 14 studies examining consumers' perceptions of electricity use by specific appliances and potential savings. Their review discusses methodological differences in how perceptions were measured.
*   Chen et al. (2024) is mentioned as providing a comparison of surveyed energy consumption estimates for categories (heating/cooling, plug load, lighting) to measured data from participants' homes.
*   Frederick et al. (2011) are cited for challenging the methodology of Attari et al. (2010), showing that estimation results are sensitive to the reference point and units used.

These studies collectively demonstrate a consistent research interest in assessing and understanding consumer perceptions and estimations of appliance energy use.

**Studies Which Included a Task Where Subjects Chose the Best Energy Reduction Tip or Plan**

Several studies incorporate tasks where participants must evaluate different energy-saving strategies, make choices between them, or formulate plans.

*   Attari et al. (2010) revealed that participants were biased towards curtailment strategies over efficiency improvements when asked for the most effective action. While not a structured choice task between multiple quantified options, it assessed participants' perceived priority among general strategy types.
*   Marghetis et al. (2019) included a Behavioral Choice Task (BCT) where participants made 20 pairwise choices about energy use/savings, selecting the option they believed would lead to greater energy savings.
*   Attari and Rajagopal (2015) discuss the need for decision aids to help consumers make effective choices in energy conservation. This implies decision-making tasks are central to the field. They also highlight the challenge of enabling consumers to choose between imprecise goals.
*   Blasch et al. (2019, 2021) used experimental tasks focused on appliance purchase decisions, requiring participants to evaluate options based on information displays to choose the most cost-efficient appliance over its lifetime. This task involves choosing the "best" option based on a specific criterion (cost efficiency).
*   Ramirez et al. (n.d.) studied how the numerical format of energy reduction goals (e.g., percentage) influences the accuracy of consumers' appliance-level conservation plans. This involves a planning task where participants formulate a set of actions (a plan) to meet a goal. The accuracy of the plan implicitly reflects the quality of the choices regarding which appliances/actions to target.
*   A simulated energy planning task is described where participants allocated energy usage across appliances to achieve a goal. This task requires participants to formulate a plan by selecting and quantifying actions.
*   Bell et al. (2016) had participants formulate specific "if-then" implementation intentions for energy saving behaviors. While not a choice task between diverse options, it involved selecting and specifying personal actions within a structured planning framework.

These studies demonstrate various approaches to assessing how individuals choose among or plan energy-saving actions, ranging from simple pairwise comparisons of perceived effectiveness to complex planning tasks requiring allocation of reductions across appliances.

**Studies That Attempted to Infer Participant Heuristics From Behavior in Decision Making Tasks**

A notable area of research focuses on identifying the cognitive shortcuts, or heuristics, that people employ when making judgments and decisions about energy use.

*   Studies have consistently found that people use heuristics when judging appliance energy consumption. The "size heuristic," where individuals perceive large appliances to consume more energy than small ones, is one of the most reported attributes used for judgment. Studies by Baird and Brier (1981), Chisik (2011), Schuitema and Steg (2005), and Cowen and Gatersleben (2017) investigated the use of the size heuristic.
*   Attari et al. (2010) attributed the systematic misperceptions (overestimating low-energy, underestimating high-energy) to "availability heuristics". They also suggested that using a reference point (100W bulb) led to an "anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic," biasing estimates towards the anchor.
*   Schley and DeKay (2015) suggested participants use a "usage pattern heuristic," where estimated energy use is perceived as larger for appliances used more often.
*   Van Den Broek and Walker (2019) specifically investigated energy judgment heuristics using mixed methods, identifying a much wider range of heuristics (24 different types) than previously documented. These included the "heat heuristic" (using heat production as an indicator of energy use), the "time-switched-on heuristic" (linking longer use time to low energy consumption per minute), and the "task size heuristic" (perceiving devices that complete larger tasks to consume more energy). Their studies included direct observations of heuristic use during judgment tasks and participants' self-reports.
*   Lesic et al. (2018) review notes that consumers use heuristics for assessing appliance electricity use.
*   Kantenbacher and Attari (2021) investigated the heuristics used by *energy experts* when making judgments about household energy use, identifying 24 unique expert heuristics and confirming that experts' estimates are more accurate than novices'. This work directly examines the cognitive shortcuts used by individuals with domain expertise.

These studies highlight that heuristic processing is prevalent in energy judgments and decision-making, leading to systematic biases, and researchers employ various methods (quantitative correlations with attributes, qualitative interviews, behavioral task analysis) to infer these cognitive shortcuts.

**Full or Aggregated Data on Human Knowledge of Common Appliance Energy Use**

The sources consistently report that public knowledge of appliance energy use is generally poor and characterized by systematic biases, rather than providing raw datasets. Aggregated findings and patterns of misperception are frequently discussed.

*   Prior research suggests people have a poor understanding of how much electricity domestic appliances use. Public perceptions are often rife with systematic and sometimes large inaccuracies.
*   A common finding across multiple studies is the tendency for people to overestimate energy use for low-energy consuming appliances or activities (e.g., light bulbs, laptops, turning off lights) and underestimate energy use for high-energy consuming appliances or activities (e.g., central air conditioners, electric clothes dryers, heating/cooling systems). This pattern of overestimation for low-use/salient items and underestimation for high-use/less visible items is frequently reported.
*   Attari et al. (2010) found that participants were unaware of large energy differences across appliances and activities. The authors reported a moderate positive correlation between participants' estimates and actual energy consumption, but concluded it was too weak to support sound decision-making. Lesic et al. (2018) review also found frequent mismatches between perceived and actual energy use.
*   Studies have shown that the accuracy of energy estimates can be influenced by methodological factors such as the reference point provided and the units used for estimation. The use of a 100W bulb as a reference point has been shown to lead to anchoring effects.
*   Cowen and Gatersleben (2017) found that correlations between perceived size and perceived energy estimates were moderately strong on average, but varied greatly between individual participants. Previous quantitative studies reported varying correlation coefficients, from r = .67 to rs = .91/.93.
*   While some qualitative studies report generally insufficient knowledge about domestic appliance energy consumption, one quantitative ranking study found participants were relatively good at ranking appliances by energy use, with a strong correlation between perceived and correct rank order.
*   Individual differences such as higher numeracy and stronger pro-environmental attitudes are associated with more accurate perceptions. Energy literacy, which correlates with planning accuracy, is generally associated with poorer understanding of energy-use information when it is low. Experts, as expected, have more accurate estimates than novices.
