*   **LLM Responses:** (As detailed previously, e.g., Confident-Correct: "**No** – a ceiling fan won’t cool the room itself...", Confident-Incorrect: "**Yes** – leaving a ceiling fan on will help keep the room itself cooler...")

**Scenario 8: Space Heater vs Central Heating (Recommendation/Comparison)**

*   **Question:** "Which is more energy-efficient: using a space heater to heat one room, or using the central heating for the whole house?"
*   **Correct Answer Basis:** Usually space heater for one room (if others unheated), despite higher cost per BTU for electricity.
*   **Incorrect Answer Basis:** Central heating is more efficient even for one room.
*   **LLM Responses:** (As detailed previously, e.g., Confident-Correct: "...space heater in that room is generally **more efficient**...", Confident-Incorrect: "...actually **more efficient to use the central heating**...")

## Energy Question Scenarios and LLM Response Stimuli

Below we present the **8 energy-related question scenarios** used in the study, along with the **AI’s responses** for each experimental condition (Confident, Uncertain-First-Person, Uncertain-General) and correctness (Correct vs. Incorrect). We also include the **prompt templates** that were used to generate these responses from the LLM. These scenarios cover estimation, comparison, and behavioral advice contexts in energy decision-making:

**Scenario 1: Thermostat Adjustment Savings**

* **Question:** *“If I lower my home thermostat by 1°F during the winter, about how much can I save on heating costs?”*
* **Correct Answer Basis:** Approximately 3% savings on heating costs per 1°F setback (a known rule of thumb).

  * **AI Response – Confident (Correct):** *“Lowering your thermostat by one degree Fahrenheit will save you about **3%** on your heating bill. It’s a modest change, but around a three percent reduction in heating costs can add up over the winter.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Correct):** *“**I’m not entirely sure, but** I believe dropping the thermostat by 1°F might save roughly **3%** on heating costs. It doesn’t sound like much, but about three percent savings over the winter can still be noticeable.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Correct):** *“**It’s not completely clear, but** turning down the thermostat by 1°F is likely to save on the order of **3%** of your heating bill. That small percentage in cost savings can accumulate over a season.”*
  * **AI Response – Confident (Incorrect):** *“Lowering your thermostat by one degree Fahrenheit will only save you about **0.5%** on your heating bill – a virtually negligible amount. Such a tiny half-percent change in costs probably wouldn’t even be noticed.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Incorrect):** *“**I’m not sure, but** I have a feeling lowering the thermostat by 1°F might only save around **half a percent** on heating costs. That would be a very small savings – maybe hardly noticeable on your bill.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Incorrect):** *“**It’s not clear, but** turning the thermostat down by 1°F probably saves as little as **0.5%** of your heating costs. Such a small saving might not make much of a difference in your overall bill.”*
* **Generation Prompt Template:** For example, to obtain the confident correct answer, the prompt was: *“You are an energy expert AI. Answer the question confidently and definitively with the correct information: If I lower my thermostat by 1°F, how much can I save on heating costs?”* For the uncertain-first-person incorrect answer, the prompt was modified to: *“Answer as if you are not sure, using ‘I’ to show uncertainty, and **use an incorrect value** (say around 0.5% instead of 3%): \[Question].”* Similar templates were used for each combination (ensuring the specified tone and correctness).

**Scenario 2: Lights On or Off Myth**

* **Question:** *“Is it more energy-efficient to leave a light bulb on if you’re coming back in a few minutes, or to turn it off each time you leave a room briefly?”*
* **Correct Answer Basis:** It is better to turn lights off; modern bulbs do not have a startup energy penalty that outweighs running them. Even for short intervals, off saves energy.

  * **AI Response – Confident (Correct):** *“You should **turn the light off** whenever you leave the room, even if it’s just for a few minutes. It is more energy-efficient to switch lights off; leaving them on needlessly wastes electricity.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Correct):** *“**I’m not 100% sure, but** I think it’s actually better to **turn the light off** every time you leave, even for a short break. I’ve heard that modern bulbs don’t waste extra energy on startup, so leaving them on would just waste power.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Correct):** *“**It’s not entirely certain, but** generally it’s more efficient to **turn lights off** whenever you’re not in the room, even for a few minutes. There isn’t a big surge in energy when turning them back on, so leaving them on would waste energy.”*
  * **AI Response – Confident (Incorrect):** *“It’s actually more efficient to **leave the light on** if you’re only stepping out briefly. Turning it off and on again uses more energy than a few minutes of running, so keeping it on saves electricity in that short span.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Incorrect):** *“**I’m not totally sure, but** I feel like if you’re coming back in a few minutes, it might be more efficient to just **leave the light on**. I recall hearing that switching on a light uses a burst of energy, so you could waste more by turning it off and on again quickly.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Incorrect):** *“**It’s not clear, but** some say it’s more efficient to **leave a light on** if you’re returning shortly. The reasoning is that flipping lights on again uses a surge of power, so in the very short term it might use less energy to just leave it on.”*
* **Generation Prompt Template:** E.g., *“Answer the question about whether to leave lights on, in a \[confident/uncertain] tone. \[If incorrect: state the common myth that leaving it on is better].”*

**Scenario 3: LED vs Incandescent Efficiency**

* **Question:** *“How much energy can you save by replacing a traditional 60W incandescent light bulb with an equivalent LED bulb?”*
* **Correct Answer Basis:** An LED of similar brightness uses \~10–12W vs 60W, about an 80% reduction in energy use.

  * **AI Response – Confident (Correct):** *“Switching a 60W incandescent to an LED of the same brightness saves around **80%** in energy. The LED might use only about 10–12 watts to produce the same light, so you’re using roughly one-fifth the power.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Correct):** *“**I’m not entirely sure, but** replacing a 60W incandescent with an LED should save roughly **80%** of the energy. I think the LED would only draw about 10 watts for similar brightness, drastically lower than 60W.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Correct):** *“**It’s not absolutely certain, but** you’ll likely save on the order of **80%** in energy by going from a 60W incandescent to an LED. In other words, the LED might use around 10–12W instead of 60W.”*
  * **AI Response – Confident (Incorrect):** *“Replacing a 60W incandescent with an LED will save only about **30%** of the energy. The LED might use roughly 40 watts to produce the same brightness, so it’s a moderate improvement but not huge.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Incorrect):** *“**I’m not sure, but** I think using an LED instead of a 60W bulb might only save around **30%** of the energy. Maybe the LED would use something like 40W instead of 60W, so you cut consumption but it’s not an enormous difference.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Incorrect):** *“**It’s not clear, but** an LED in place of a 60W bulb probably uses only about **30%** less energy. It might draw around 40W for similar light output, which is a bit better than 60W.”*
* **Prompt Template:** *“The user asks about LED vs 60W incandescent savings. Give a \[tone] answer. \[If correct: use 80% saving]. \[If incorrect: understate savings \~30%].”*

**Scenario 4: Laundry Temperature Energy Use**

* **Question:** *“Does washing clothes in cold water instead of hot water really save energy, and if so, how much?”*
* **Correct Answer Basis:** Yes, it saves a lot – heating water is \~75–90% of the energy of a wash cycle. Cold vs hot can save that portion (e.g., on the order of 70-90% energy per load).

  * **AI Response – Confident (Correct):** *“Yes – washing in cold water **saves a lot of energy**, on the order of 70–90% per load compared to hot water. Most of a washer’s energy goes into heating water, so using cold means you avoid nearly all of that heating energy.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Correct):** *“**I’m not completely sure of the exact figure, but** washing clothes in cold water definitely **saves most of the energy** used in a hot wash. I’ve heard it could be around a 75–90% energy savings per load, since almost all the energy in hot washing goes to heating the water.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Correct):** *“**It’s not entirely certain, but** using cold water instead of hot can **save the majority of the energy** for a laundry load – roughly on the order of 80% savings. That’s because heating the water uses most of the energy in a wash cycle, so cold washes avoid nearly all that usage.”*
  * **AI Response – Confident (Incorrect):** *“Using cold water instead of hot **doesn’t save much energy** – maybe around a 10% reduction at best. The washing machine’s energy use is mostly from running the motor, so water temperature doesn’t make a big difference for energy.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Incorrect):** *“**I’m not sure it saves that much –** maybe only around a **10%** energy savings by washing in cold. I think the machine still uses a lot of energy for spinning and such, so not heating the water might not reduce the total energy by a large percentage.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Incorrect):** *“**It’s not clear that cold washing saves a lot –** probably only on the order of **10%** in energy savings. In other words, skipping water heating might not dramatically cut the overall energy, since the washer’s other functions still use most of the power.”*
* **Prompt Template:** *“Provide an answer about cold vs hot water washing. \[Correct: Emphasize big \~80% savings]. \[Incorrect: Say only \~10%]. Include uncertainty phrasing if required by tone.”*

**Scenario 5: Phantom Load (Electronics on Standby)**

* **Question:** *“Do chargers and devices that are plugged in but not in use (on standby) consume much electricity? For example, if I leave my phone charger plugged in all day, is that adding a lot to my bill?”*
* **Correct Answer Basis:** Most unplugged chargers/devices draw a very small standby power (a few watts or less); collectively phantom load \~5–10% of household usage. So individually, a phone charger is negligible (<\$1/year), but all standby combined could be \~5–10% of bill.

  * **AI Response – Confident (Correct):** *“Devices on standby do use a little electricity, but it’s generally **very small**. A phone charger left plugged in draws only a fraction of a watt – likely costing just cents per year. Even all your standby devices together might be around 5–10% of your home’s electricity use, but any single charger is negligible.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Correct):** *“**I’m not entirely sure, but** I believe plugged-in chargers and idle devices draw **very little power**. A phone charger with no phone might use only a tiny trickle (maybe under a watt). So by itself it adds maybe a few cents to your bill. Overall, all standby power in a home might add up to perhaps 5–10% of usage, but one charger is almost nothing.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Correct):** *“**It’s not completely clear, but** most idle chargers and devices use **very minimal electricity**. A phone charger left plugged in probably consumes only a fraction of a watt, which is just pennies in electricity over a year. In total, ‘phantom’ loads in a home can be around 5–10% of usage, but any single device’s contribution is very small.”*
  * **AI Response – Confident (Incorrect):** *“Yes – plugged-in chargers and standby devices **use a lot of electricity**. This ‘vampire power’ can account for as much as **30%** of your electric bill if you leave many things plugged in. So a phone charger constantly plugged in could be quietly using significant energy.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Incorrect):** *“**I’m not sure, but** I’ve heard that idle devices can actually **draw quite a lot of power** over time. Some say it could be around **30%** of your home’s electricity coming from devices just being plugged in even when off. So leaving your phone charger in the outlet might be contributing a surprising amount to your bill.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Incorrect):** *“**It’s not certain, but** leaving devices plugged in is often said to **waste a substantial amount of power** – possibly around **30%** of household electricity usage. That means things like an unused phone charger could indeed be adding significantly to your bill if left plugged in continuously.”*
* **Prompt Template:** *“Answer about standby power usage. \[Correct: emphasize very low usage, mention 5-10% total]. \[Incorrect: claim high \~30%]. Tone per condition.”*

**Scenario 6: Solar Panel Payback Time**

* **Question:** *“Approximately how many years does it take for a typical home solar panel installation to pay for itself (through energy savings)?”*
* **Correct Answer Basis:** Average solar payback \~6–12 years in many areas (we’ll use \~8-10 years as a representative figure).

  * **AI Response – Confident (Correct):** *“On average, residential solar panels **pay for themselves in about 8 to 10 years**. The exact payback period can vary by location and incentives, but roughly a decade is typical for many homes to recoup the costs in energy savings.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Correct):** *“**I’m not exactly sure, but** I’d estimate it takes on the order of **8 to 12 years** for home solar panels to pay for themselves. In many cases you start seeing net savings after around a decade, though it depends on local factors.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Correct):** *“**It’s not entirely certain since it varies, but** a typical home solar installation might **pay off its cost in roughly 7–12 years**. In other words, after around a decade, the energy savings have likely equaled the upfront cost for many systems.”*
  * **AI Response – Confident (Incorrect):** *“It typically takes **over 20 years** for home solar panels to pay for themselves. In many areas, you wouldn’t recoup your investment until two decades or more of energy savings.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Incorrect):** *“**I’m not completely sure, but** I think it might take **around 20 years or more** for solar panels to pay themselves off. That would mean you’d be waiting a couple of decades to break even on the installation cost.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Incorrect):** *“**It’s not clear-cut and depends on factors, but** you might be looking at **20+ years** for a typical solar panel setup to pay back its cost through savings. In other words, possibly over two decades to reach the break-even point.”*
* **Prompt Template:** *“Answer about solar payback time. \[Correct: \~10 years range]. \[Incorrect: say 20+ years]. Ensure \[confident or uncertain] style as specified.”*

**Scenario 7: Ceiling Fan Usage**

* **Question:** *“If I leave a ceiling fan on in an empty room, will it actually cool the room (making it worthwhile to leave it running)?”*
* **Correct Answer Basis:** No, fans cool people not air; leaving it on in empty room wastes energy.

  * **AI Response – Confident (Correct):** *“No – a ceiling fan won’t cool the room itself when no one is there. Fans don’t lower air temperature; they only help people feel cooler by moving air. Leaving it on in an empty room just wastes electricity without providing a cooling benefit.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Correct):** *“**I’m not entirely sure, but** I’m pretty sure a fan won’t actually cool the room’s air if no one’s there. It mainly makes people feel cooler by evaporation. So running it in an empty room would just use energy for no real benefit in cooling the space.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Correct):** *“**It’s not completely certain, but** a ceiling fan doesn’t truly cool the room itself – it cools people via airflow. If no one is in the room to feel that breeze, leaving the fan on is just wasting energy and isn’t actively lowering the room’s temperature.”*
  * **AI Response – Confident (Incorrect):** *“Yes – leaving a ceiling fan on will help keep the room itself cooler. The fan circulates the air and can lower the perceived temperature in the room, so it’s beneficial to run it even if you step away for a while.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Incorrect):** *“**I’m not sure, but** I think keeping the ceiling fan on might actually help cool the room itself. It could circulate air and maybe bring down the overall temperature a bit, so running it even when the room is empty might help keep it cooler.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Incorrect):** *“**It’s not entirely clear, but** leaving a ceiling fan running could keep the room cooler by maintaining air circulation. So even without someone present, it might be worthwhile for keeping the room’s temperature down.”*
* **Prompt Template:** *“Answer about leaving a fan on. \[Correct: clearly say no cooling effect]. \[Incorrect: claim it helps cool the room]. Use appropriate certainty tone.”*

**Scenario 8: Space Heater vs Central Heating** (Comparison)

* **Question:** *“Which is more energy-efficient: using a space heater to heat one room, or using the central heating to heat the whole house?”*
* **Correct Answer Basis:** If only one room is needed, a space heater can be more efficient than running furnace for whole house, but electric space heat can be expensive per unit energy; depends on scenario. Likely answer: heating just one room with a space heater *can* save energy compared to heating entire house, but electric cost per BTU is higher than gas. (This one is nuanced; we’ll assume a typical scenario where yes, heating one room is better if you don’t heat other rooms.)

  * **AI Response – Confident (Correct):** *“If you only need one room heated, using a space heater in that room is generally **more efficient** than turning on central heat for the whole house. You’ll use less total energy by not warming unused rooms (though keep in mind electric heaters can be costly per unit of heat).”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Correct):** *“**I’m not totally sure, but** if you just want to heat a single room, a space heater is probably **more efficient** than running the central heating for the entire house. You avoid wasting heat on rooms you’re not using. Just remember that electric heaters have a higher cost per heat unit, but focusing heat on one room should still save energy overall.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Correct):** *“**It’s not absolutely certain in every case, but** using a space heater for one room is usually **more energy-efficient** than heating the whole house centrally when you don’t need all that space warmed. You’re concentrating energy where it’s needed. The caveat is that electric heat can be expensive, but it often uses less total energy than running a furnace to heat everything.”*
  * **AI Response – Confident (Incorrect):** *“It’s actually **more efficient to use the central heating** even if you only want one room warm. Modern furnaces are very efficient, and running a big HVAC system for the whole house wastes less energy than using a small, power-hungry space heater in one room.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (First-Person, Incorrect):** *“**I’m not sure, but** I think it might be **better to use the central heating** rather than a space heater. Even if you only need one room, central systems can be efficient in circulating heat. A single space heater might actually consume a lot of electricity, so it could be less efficient than using your furnace to heat the house.”*
  * **AI Response – Uncertain (General, Incorrect):** *“**It’s not clear, but** using the **central heating might be more efficient** than a space heater, even for one room. Central heaters can be quite efficient overall, and a space heater could end up using a surprisingly large amount of electricity to keep that room warm.”*
* **Prompt Template:** *“Answer about space heater vs central. \[Correct: one room with space heater is more efficient; acknowledge nuance]. \[Incorrect: claim central is more efficient for one room]. Style per condition.”*

These scenario responses will be embedded into the survey for each condition. Each participant will see one version of each scenario corresponding to their assigned condition (Confident / Uncertain-1st / Uncertain-Gen). The **correctness of the AI’s answer** in each scenario is predetermined (e.g., Scenarios 1, 4, 6, 8 could be correct answers; 2, 3, 5, 7 incorrect – this distribution can be balanced so each participant sees an equal number of correct vs incorrect responses). The ordering of scenarios will be randomized.

. Scenario-Based LLM Beliefs Questions
These scenarios aim to probe beliefs in more contextually rich situations:

Scenario 1: Conflicting Information
"Imagine you're trying to decide between two models of refrigerators. You look up their EnergyGuide labels online. You then ask an AI chatbot (like ChatGPT or Gemini) which one is more efficient. The chatbot recommends Model A, but based on your reading of the labels, you thought Model B was slightly better.
How accurate do you think the chatbot's recommendation is likely to be in this situation? (Scale: Very Inaccurate to Very Accurate)
How much would you trust the chatbot's recommendation over your own interpretation of the labels? (Scale: Trust Chatbot Much Less to Trust Chatbot Much More)
What do you think explains the difference? (e.g., Chatbot has newer data, Chatbot made a mistake, I misread the label, Chatbot misunderstood my question)"
Scenario 2: High-Stakes Decision
"Suppose you are considering installing solar panels on your roof, a major investment. You ask an AI chatbot to estimate the total cost, potential energy savings per year, and the payback period for your specific home address and electricity usage. The chatbot provides detailed figures that look promising.
How accurate do you believe these AI-generated financial estimates (cost, savings, payback) are likely to be? (Scale)
How confident would you be in making the investment based primarily on the chatbot's analysis? (Scale)
Why? What factors influence your confidence? (Open-ended or checklist: e.g., AI's access to local pricing, AI's understanding of my roof/sunlight, risk of AI errors, need for human expert confirmation)"
Scenario 3: Behavioral Plan Evaluation
"You ask an AI chatbot to create a personalized plan to help you reduce your household electricity bill by 20% this winter. The plan includes: (1) Turning off lights when leaving a room, (2) Unplugging phone chargers when not in use, (3) Lowering your thermostat by 5 degrees Fahrenheit, (4) Replacing your old refrigerator with a new ENERGY STAR model.
How effective do you think this entire plan would be in achieving the 20% savings goal? (Scale: Not at all effective to Extremely effective)
How confident are you that the AI correctly prioritized the actions with the biggest impact? (Scale)
Which part of the plan do you think the AI estimated the savings for most accurately? Least accurately? (Multiple choice or ranking)" (This probes if users recognize the scale difference between actions, echoing Attari et al., 2010).

## **5\. Proposed Scenario-Based LLM Belief Questions (Illustrative)**

To supplement the direct belief statements and accuracy evaluation tasks, the following types of scenario-based questions can probe users' functional understanding and expectations regarding LLM behavior in energy contexts (incorporating To-Do item 16):

**Scenario Type 1: Data Access & Timeliness**

* **Scenario:** "You ask the LLM: 'What was the average residential electricity price in California last month?' How likely is the LLM to provide the precise, correct average price for that specific month?" (Scale: Very Unlikely to Very Likely)  
* **Follow-up (MCQ):** "Why? (a) LLMs have real-time access to all public economic data. (b) LLMs might access slightly outdated databases. (c) LLMs primarily generate text based on patterns, not real-time data lookups. (d) The LLM's access depends on the specific utility company data availability."  
* **Rationale:** Assesses understanding of LLM limitations regarding real-time, specific data access versus generating plausible text based on training data.

**Scenario Type 2: Calculation & Reasoning**

* **Scenario:** "You provide the LLM with your detailed monthly electricity usage (kWh) for the past year and your utility's complex tiered pricing structure. You ask: 'Calculate my exact total electricity cost for last year.' How confident are you that the LLM's calculated total would be perfectly accurate?" (Scale: Not at all Confident to Extremely Confident)  
* **Follow-up (Open-ended):** "What potential challenges or errors might the LLM encounter in performing this calculation accurately?"  
* **Rationale:** Probes beliefs about the LLM's mathematical reasoning capabilities, handling of complex instructions, and potential for errors in multi-step calculations, especially those involving specific, structured data formats (like utility tariffs).

**Scenario Type 3: Contextual Understanding & Personalization**

* **Scenario:** "You tell the LLM: 'I live in a 2-bedroom apartment in Phoenix, Arizona, built in 1990\. Give me the single most cost-effective way to lower my summer electricity bill.' How likely is it that the LLM's *single* suggestion will genuinely be the *most* cost-effective option specifically for your situation?" (Scale: Very Unlikely to Very Likely)  
* **Follow-up (MCQ):** "Why? (a) The LLM can perfectly model my specific apartment and local conditions. (b) The LLM will likely give a generally good tip, but maybe not the single *best* one for me. (c) The LLM doesn't truly understand my unique context (e.g., insulation quality, window type) beyond the basic description. (d) The LLM might prioritize common advice over niche but potentially more impactful solutions."  
* **Rationale:** Assesses understanding of the LLM's limitations in deep contextual reasoning and personalization, contrasting general advice generation with tailored optimization based on unstated variables.

**Scenario Type 4: Bias & Influence**

* **Scenario:** "Imagine an LLM developed by a major solar panel company. You ask it: 'Should I install solar panels on my home?' How likely is the LLM's response to be influenced by its developer's business interests?" (Scale: Very Unlikely to Very Likely)  
* **Follow-up (Open-ended):** "How might this influence manifest in the LLM's response?"  
* **Rationale:** Probes awareness of potential biases in AI systems, stemming from training data or developer motivations, particularly relevant for advice involving significant financial decisions.

These scenario-based questions aim to elicit more applied understanding than abstract belief statements, providing richer data on how users expect LLMs to function (and fail) in realistic energy-related query situations.

**Instructions:** Below are hypothetical answers an AI chatbot (like ChatGPT) might give to questions about household energy. Please read each answer and respond to the questions that follow.

**Scenario 1: Appliance Estimation**

*   **Question to AI:** "How much electricity does a typical electric clothes dryer use per load?"
*   **AI Answer:** "A typical electric clothes dryer uses about **0.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh)** per load. So, running it frequently won't impact your bill much compared to other appliances like your refrigerator."
    *   **Q1.1:** How accurate do you believe the AI's estimate of **0.5 kWh per load** is? *(Scale: 1=Very Inaccurate to 7=Very Accurate)*
    *   **Q1.2:** How confident are you (0-100%) that the AI's estimate of 0.5 kWh is correct? `________ %` *(Part of Calibration Task)*
    *   **Q1.3:** Based on this answer, how trustworthy do you find the AI for estimating appliance energy use? *(Scale: 1=Not at all Trustworthy to 7=Very Trustworthy)*
    *   **Q1.4:** Would you rely on this specific 0.5 kWh estimate if deciding how often to use your dryer? *(Options: Yes, definitely / Yes, probably / Unsure / No, probably not / No, definitely not)*

*(Note: Actual average ≈ 3-4 kWh. This tests detection of significant underestimation).*

**Scenario 2: Conservation Plan Advice**

*   **Question to AI:** "What's the single most effective thing I can do to save energy in my apartment this winter?"
*   **AI Answer:** "The single most effective thing is definitely to **unplug all your electronics when you're not using them**, especially chargers and TVs. These 'phantom loads' add up significantly and tackling them first will give you the biggest savings."
    *   **Q2.1:** How accurate do you believe the AI's claim is that unplugging electronics is the *single most effective* action for winter energy savings in an apartment? *(Scale: 1=Very Inaccurate to 7=Very Accurate)*
    *   **Q2.2:** How confident are you (0-100%) that the AI's advice here is correct (i.e., phantom load reduction is the *most* effective winter action)? `________ %` *(Part of Calibration Task)*
    *   **Q2.3:** How useful do you find this specific piece of advice? *(Scale: 1=Not at all Useful to 7=Very Useful)*
    *   **Q2.4:** If this was the main advice given, how likely would you be to focus your efforts primarily on unplugging devices this winter? *(Scale: 1=Very Unlikely to 7=Very Likely)*

*(Note: Usually incorrect; heating adjustments are far more impactful. Tests detection of misplaced priorities potentially mirroring common misperceptions).*

**Scenario 3: Factual Concept Explanation**

*   **Question to AI:** "Explain what an ENERGY STAR rating means for appliances."
*   **AI Answer:** "ENERGY STAR labels appliances meeting strict EPA efficiency guidelines. Choosing an ENERGY STAR model means it uses significantly less energy – usually **at least 50% less** – saving you money and helping the environment."
    *   **Q3.1:** How accurate do you believe the AI's explanation of the ENERGY STAR program is? *(Scale: 1=Very Inaccurate to 7=Very Accurate)*
    *   **Q3.2:** How confident are you (0-100%) that the AI's explanation, including the "at least 50% less" figure, is correct? `________ %` *(Part of Calibration Task)*
    *   **Q3.3:** How helpful is this explanation? *(Scale: 1=Not at all Helpful to 7=Very Helpful)*
    *   **Q3.4:** How much would you trust the AI to accurately explain other energy standards? *(Scale: 1=Distrust Completely to 7=Trust Completely)*

*(Note: Explanation generally correct, but "at least 50% less" is often an exaggeration. Tests ability to spot potentially inflated quantitative claims within correct text).*

### Suggested Scenario-Based LLM Beliefs Questions

Based on the sources' recommendations for task-specificity, scenarios, and probing nuances:

*   **Scenario 1 (Quantitative Estimation):** Imagine you ask an LLM, "My air conditioner is 1500 watts, and I run it for 8 hours a day. Roughly how much does it add to my monthly electricity bill?" The LLM gives you a specific dollar amount.
    *   *Belief Question:* On a scale of 1 (Very Inaccurate) to 7 (Very Accurate), how accurate do you think that dollar amount provided by the LLM is likely to be?
    *   *Nuance Question:* Compared to your own best guess or a quick calculation you could do, how accurate do you think the LLM's dollar amount is? (Scale: Much Less Accurate than Me to Much More Accurate than Me)
    *   *Reasoning Probe:* Why do you think the LLM would be accurate or inaccurate for this type of calculation? (Open-ended or Likert: "Because LLMs have access to real-time electricity prices," "Because LLMs are good at math," "Because energy calculations are complicated," etc.)

*   **Scenario 2 (Factual Recall/Comparison):** Imagine you ask an LLM, "Which uses less energy, an LED light bulb or an incandescent one? And how much less?" The LLM tells you that LEDs use less and gives you a percentage difference.
    *   *Belief Question:* How accurate do you think the LLM's statement that LEDs use less energy than incandescents is? (Scale: Very Inaccurate to Very Accurate)
    *   *Belief Question:* How accurate do you think the specific percentage difference provided by the LLM is likely to be? (Scale: Very Inaccurate to Very Accurate)

*   **Scenario 3 (Personalized Planning):** Imagine you ask an LLM, "What's the best way for me to save $50 a month on my electricity bill in a two-bedroom apartment?" The LLM provides a list of personalized recommendations based on typical apartment energy use.
    *   *Belief Question:* How accurate do you think the LLM's recommendations are likely to be for helping *you* save $50/month? (Scale: Very Inaccurate to Very Accurate)
    *   *Utility Question:* How useful do you think these personalized recommendations from the LLM would be for you in making energy decisions? (Scale: Not Useful at All to Very Useful)
    *   *Bias Reflection Probe:* How likely is the LLM's advice to suggest unplugging small electronics (low impact) compared to actions like improving insulation or upgrading appliances (high impact)? (Scale: Very Unlikely to Very Likely) (This subtly probes if users expect the AI to replicate known human biases in focusing on low-impact actions).

*   **Scenario 4 (Potential Error/Hallucination):** Imagine you ask an LLM for advice on reducing your gas heating bill, and it confidently suggests opening windows to improve air circulation and reduce heating load. (This is objectively incorrect/counterproductive in cold weather).
    *   *Belief Question:* How likely do you think an LLM is to give advice like "open windows to reduce heating bill"? (Scale: Very Unlikely to Very Likely) (Probes awareness of potential errors/hallucinations).
    *   *Trust Question (Scenario-Specific):* If the LLM gave you this advice (open windows), how much would you trust it? (Scale: Not at All to Very Much)

### Suggesting Scenario-Based LLM Beliefs Questions

While the sources discuss scenario-based tasks primarily for measuring *reliance* behavior and calibration, the format can be adapted to measure *beliefs* about specific LLM outputs presented within realistic energy scenarios. This moves beyond general perceived accuracy to evaluate beliefs about concrete examples, potentially revealing how cues within the AI response itself influence user judgment.

Here are some potential scenario-based LLM belief questions, framed around presenting participants with specific hypothetical LLM outputs related to energy tasks within vignettes:

*(Vignette: Imagine you asked an LLM how much energy a standard refrigerator uses in a year. You receive Output A: "A standard refrigerator uses about 350 kWh per year.")*

1.  **Perceived Accuracy for Specific Output:** Based on this output, how accurate do you think the LLM is at estimating refrigerator energy use? (e.g., 7-point Likert: Very Inaccurate to Very Accurate)
2.  **Confidence in Specific Output:** How confident are you that this specific energy estimate (350 kWh/year) is correct? (e.g., Slider 0-100%)
3.  **Perceived Certainty/Confidence of AI:** How certain does the LLM seem about this estimate in Output A? (e.g., 7-point Likert: Not at all Certain to Very Certain)
4.  **Likelihood of Human-like Error:** Based on Output A, how likely do you think the LLM is to make the same kinds of energy estimation mistakes that people typically make? (e.g., 7-point Likert: Very Unlikely to Very Likely)
5.  **Attribution for Output (Mental Model):** Why do you think the LLM provided this specific number (350 kWh/year)? (Open-ended text box)

*(Vignette: Imagine you asked an LLM for a personalized plan to reduce your home energy bill. You receive Output B: "To save energy, you should turn off lights when you leave a room. This is one of the most effective actions you can take.")*

6.  **Perceived Accuracy of Claim:** How accurate do you think the claim in Output B ("turning off lights is one of the most effective actions...") is? (e.g., 7-point Likert: Very Inaccurate to Very Accurate)
7.  **Perceived Utility of Plan:** How useful do you think this specific suggestion from the LLM would be for reducing *your* energy bill? (e.g., 7-point Likert: Not at all Useful to Extremely Useful)
8.  **Task-Specific Trust (Planning):** Based on Output B, how much do you trust the LLM to generate an effective personalized energy-saving plan? (e.g., 7-point Likert: Not at all Trustworthy to Very Trustworthy)

By presenting varied LLM outputs (some potentially accurate, some reflecting common human biases or LLM limitations) within scenarios and asking focused belief questions *about those specific outputs*, researchers can gain insights into how users evaluate AI performance in context and whether their beliefs are sensitive to the nuances or potential flaws of the generated content. This complements broader perceived accuracy measures and provides a bridge towards understanding behavioral reliance observed in similar scenario tasks.
