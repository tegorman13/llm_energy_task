## **Justification Report**

**1\. Introduction**

This report details the construction and rationale behind the survey instrument designed to explore the relationships between AI literacy, trust in AI, numeracy, and energy literacy. The primary goal is to gather data that allows for an analysis of how these constructs interact within a general population sample. The survey employs established scales where available and appropriate, supplemented by custom demographic questions. The structure and item selection prioritize validity, reliability, and respondent burden, aiming for a completion time of approximately 15-20 minutes.

**2\. Overall Structure and Flow**

The survey is organized into distinct sections to ensure clarity and logical progression for the respondent. It begins with an **Introduction and Consent** form, outlining the study's purpose, ensuring voluntary participation, and guaranteeing confidentiality, adhering to ethical research standards.

**Section A: Demographics** follows, collecting essential background information (age, gender, education, employment). These variables are crucial for understanding the sample composition and for analyzing potential group differences in the main constructs of interest. Optional questions about field of study/occupation and technology usage provide further context.

**Section B: AI Literacy** utilizes the MAILS-Short scale. Placing this section early allows for gauging the respondent's self-perceived understanding and skills related to AI before delving into trust perceptions. This placement helps establish a baseline of AI familiarity.

**Section C: Trust in AI** employs a revised version of the Trust in Automation Scale (TPA). This section logically follows the AI literacy assessment, allowing respondents to reflect on their general trust and distrust towards AI systems based on their understanding. The use of separate trust and distrust subscales, as recommended by recent psychometric evaluations, provides a more nuanced measure than a single bipolar scale.

**Section D: Numeracy** introduces the Berlin Numeracy Test (Short Version). This section requires focused cognitive effort and is placed mid-survey to avoid potential fatigue effects influencing performance if placed at the very end. Numeracy skills are relevant as they may influence how individuals process information related to AI capabilities or energy statistics.

**Section E: Energy Literacy** uses selected items from the Energy Literacy Questionnaire (ELQ). This section assesses knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to energy. Placing it later allows for a shift in topic focus after the more abstract AI and numeracy sections.

Finally, a **Conclusion** thanks participants for their time and contribution. This flow aims to maintain respondent engagement and minimize potential carryover effects between unrelated constructs.

**3\. Scale Selection and Rationale**

The selection of measurement instruments was guided by the need for validated, reliable, and contextually appropriate scales, while also considering the overall survey length.

* **AI Literacy (MAILS-Short):** The Meta-Artificial Intelligence Literacy Scale (MAILS) provides a comprehensive framework covering various facets of AI literacy, including understanding, application, ethics, and self-perceived competence. The short version (MAILS-Short) offers a practical, 10-item measure suitable for survey research, demonstrated to have good model fit. It captures the user's self-assessment of their ability to interact with, understand, and critically evaluate AI systems.  
* **Trust in AI (TPA \- Revised):** The Trust in (Automation) Scale (TPA) is a widely used measure in human-automation interaction research. Recent studies specifically examining its psychometric properties in the context of AI suggest that the original single-factor structure performs poorly. Instead, a two-factor model distinguishing between **Trust** (items reflecting confidence, reliability, dependability) and **Distrust** (items reflecting suspicion, wariness, concern) shows better validity and reliability. This distinction is crucial as trust and distrust may function as separate constructs rather than opposite ends of a single spectrum. The survey adopts this validated two-factor structure, using the specific items identified as loading onto these factors , without reverse-scoring the distrust items, as recommended. This approach allows for a more nuanced measurement of the user's relationship with AI, acknowledging that one might simultaneously hold feelings of trust and distrust.  
* **Numeracy (Berlin Numeracy Test \- Short):** Numeracy, particularly the ability to understand probabilities and statistical information (risk literacy), is increasingly relevant in a data-driven world and influences decision-making in various contexts. The Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT) is a well-validated instrument designed to measure this construct. The 4-item paper-and-pencil version provides a quick yet effective assessment of statistical reasoning and risk literacy, shown to be a strong predictor of comprehension in various domains. Its inclusion allows for examining how numerical ability relates to understanding and trust in complex systems like AI or interpreting energy-related data.  
* **Energy Literacy (ELQ \- Selected Items):** The Energy Literacy Questionnaire (ELQ) developed by DeWaters and Powers is a comprehensive tool assessing the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of energy literacy. Given the survey length constraints, a selection of items representing each dimension was chosen based on their relevance and coverage of key energy concepts (e.g., sources, conservation, environmental impact) as identified in the original instrument development and validation studies. This selection aims to capture the core aspects of energy literacy without overburdening respondents. The distinction between cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions is maintained, as research suggests these components relate differently to each other and to outcomes.

**4\. Item Selection (Energy Literacy Questionnaire)**

The ELQ originally contains 56 items. To ensure a manageable survey length, a subset of 15 items was selected, aiming to represent the three core dimensions:

* **Cognitive (4 items):** Chosen to cover fundamental knowledge about energy sources (renewable vs. non-renewable), primary energy use areas (home consumption), dominant energy sources (national level), and key environmental impacts (climate change causes). These items provide a basic assessment of factual understanding.  
* **Affective (6 items):** Selected to gauge attitudes towards energy conservation importance, personal responsibility, trust in technological solutions versus conservation, and willingness to support pro-environmental policies or accept trade-offs. These items reflect underlying values and beliefs driving energy-related decisions.  
* **Behavioral (5 items):** Focus on self-reported frequency of common energy-saving actions (lights, computer use, water conservation, transportation) and willingness to influence others, providing an indicator of practical engagement with energy conservation.

This selection balances breadth across the dimensions with the need for brevity, focusing on items with broad applicability and relevance.

**5\. Formatting and Usability**

The survey is formatted using Pandoc Markdown for clarity and ease of deployment across different platforms. Each section is clearly demarcated with headings. Instructions are provided for each question type (e.g., Likert scale anchors, multiple-choice instructions). The use of established scales with clear response formats (Likert scales, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank for BNT) enhances usability and data quality.

**6\. Estimated Completion Time**

Based on the number and type of questions in each section, the estimated completion time is between 11 and 17 minutes. This duration is considered reasonable for online surveys and aims to maximize completion rates while minimizing respondent fatigue.

**7\. Addressing Research Questions/Hypotheses**

The selected measures and their arrangement allow for the investigation of several key research questions:

* **Baseline Levels:** The survey will provide descriptive statistics on the levels of AI literacy (MAILS-Short), trust and distrust in AI (TPA-Revised), numeracy (BNT), and the three dimensions of energy literacy (ELQ subscales) within the sample.  
* **AI Literacy and Trust:** By correlating MAILS-Short scores with TPA-Trust and TPA-Distrust scores, the relationship between understanding AI and trusting (or distrusting) it can be examined. It allows exploration of whether higher perceived literacy leads to more calibrated trust (i.e., appropriate levels of trust and distrust based on context) or potentially increased skepticism.  
* **Numeracy's Role:** Correlating BNT scores with MAILS-Short and TPA scores will help understand if numerical ability influences how people perceive and trust AI. Higher numeracy might correlate with a better grasp of AI's probabilistic nature, potentially affecting trust levels. Similarly, numeracy's link to energy literacy (especially the cognitive component) can be assessed.  
* **Interplay of Constructs:** The survey facilitates exploring the complex interplay between these variables. For example, does trust in AI influence the acceptance of AI-driven energy solutions? Is energy-saving behavior (ELQ-Behavioral) predicted more strongly by energy-related attitudes (ELQ-Affective) or knowledge (ELQ-Cognitive), and how do AI literacy and trust modify these relationships? Research suggests affect and behavior are often more strongly linked than knowledge and behavior in the energy domain.  
* **Demographic Influences:** Analyzing responses across different demographic groups (age, education, etc.) will reveal potential variations in literacy, trust, and behaviors, providing valuable insights for targeted communication or educational strategies.

In conclusion, this survey instrument, combining established and adapted scales, is designed to gather comprehensive data on AI literacy, trust, numeracy, and energy literacy. The structure and item selection are informed by psychometric principles and existing research, aiming to provide reliable and valid data for exploring the relationships between these critical constructs within a manageable survey length. The inclusion of distinct trust and distrust measures and the multi-dimensional assessment of energy literacy allows for a nuanced analysis of public perceptions and behaviors related to technology and sustainability.
