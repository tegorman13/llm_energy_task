## Justification Report

This survey instrument is designed to comprehensively address the research questions (RQs) and hypotheses (H) outlined in the study proposal, drawing on validated scales and tailored custom items where necessary.

**Alignment with Research Questions and Hypotheses:**

1.  **RQ1 & H1 (Lay Beliefs about LLM Accuracy/Utility; Differentiated Trust):**
    *   **Sections 4 (Beliefs) & 5 (Task-Specific Trust)** directly address RQ1. Custom items probe perceived accuracy (**4.1**) and utility (**4.2**) for specific energy tasks (estimation vs. planning). Task-specific trust (**5**) measures differentiated trust levels.
    *   **H1** (Perceptions reflect human biases) is addressed by including items on estimating savings from high-impact (4.1.3) vs. low-impact (4.1.4) actions and including the **Attari et al. Estimation Task (2.4)** to establish a baseline of participant bias. Item 4.1.6 also probes awareness of hallucination. Comparing perceived LLM accuracy patterns (Sec 4.1) to baseline human estimation patterns (Sec 2.4) will test H1.

2.  **RQ2 & H2a-c (Predictors: Numeracy, Energy Literacy, AI Literacy):**
    *   **Section 1 (Numeracy):** Uses the **Berlin Numeracy Test (4-item Traditional)** to objectively measure numeracy, addressing **H2a**.
    *   **Section 2 (Energy Literacy):** Uses selected items from the **DeWaters & Powers ELQ** covering Cognitive Knowledge (**2.1**), Affective Attitudes (**2.2**), and Behavioral aspects (**2.3**), providing the multidimensional measure needed. **Section 2.4 (Attari Estimation)** further assesses energy perception knowledge relevant to H2b. Cognitive knowledge items (**2.1**) are key for **H2b**.
    *   **Section 3 (AI Literacy):** Employs the validated **MAILS-Short form**, capturing facets like understanding, evaluation, and application, directly addressing **H2c**.

3.  **RQ3 & H3 (Beliefs/Trust -> Willingness/Frequency):**
    *   **Section 7 (LLM Use Intentions & Frequency):** Contains custom items measuring Willingness to Use (**7.1**) and Past Usage Frequency (**7.2**) *specifically for energy tasks*.
    *   These outcome variables will be predicted by scores from Section 4 (Beliefs) and Section 5 (Task-Specific Trust), directly testing **H3**.

4.  **RQ4 & H4 (Mediation/Moderation by General AI Trust/Distrust):**
    *   **Section 6 (General Trust & Distrust in AI):** Measures this using two validated approaches:
        *   The **TPA scale (6.1)** captures general trust and distrust facets.
        *   The **Semantic Differential Cognitive Trust scale (6.2)** provides a focused measure of cognitive aspects like reliability and competence.
    *   Scores from this section will be used in mediation/moderation analyses to test **H4**.

**Overall Structure & Feasibility:**

*   **Logical Flow:** The survey progresses from stable individual differences (Numeracy, Literacies) to specific LLM perceptions (Beliefs, Task-Specific Trust), then broader AI trust, and finally behavioral outcomes (Intentions/Frequency), concluding with demographics. This minimizes priming effects. Placing the Attari task within Energy Literacy allows assessment of baseline perceptions before LLM-specific questions.
*   **Validated Instruments:** Utilizes standard, validated scales where available (BNT, ELQ items, MAILS-Short, TPA, Shang & Hsieh Cognitive Trust).
*   **Custom Items:** Targeted custom items are included where validated scales are lacking for the specific context (LLM beliefs/trust/use *for energy tasks*). These items are designed based on theoretical constructs and formats from related literature.
*   **Runtime:** The instrument includes approximately 90 scored items (plus demographics). Estimating 15-20 seconds per item yields a total time of 22-30 minutes, fitting the target range. Using short forms (MAILS-Short, BNT-4, ELQ subset, Shang Cognitive subset) helps manage length.

**Conclusion:** This survey instrument provides a well-structured and comprehensive approach to measuring the required constructs. It integrates validated scales with necessary custom items, directly aligning with the RQs and Hs of the proposal, while remaining feasible for online administration.

## Justification Report

This survey instrument is designed to comprehensively address the research questions (RQs) and hypotheses (H) outlined in the study proposal, drawing on validated scales and tailored custom items where necessary.

**Alignment with Research Questions and Hypotheses:**

1.  **RQ1 & H1 (Lay Beliefs about LLM Accuracy/Utility; Differentiated Trust):**
    *   **Sections 4 (Beliefs) & 5 (Task-Specific Trust)** directly address RQ1. Custom items probe perceived accuracy (**4.1**) and utility (**4.2**) for specific energy tasks (estimation vs. planning). Task-specific trust (**5**) measures differentiated trust levels.
    *   **H1** (Perceptions reflect human biases) is addressed by including items on estimating savings from high-impact (4.1.3) vs. low-impact (4.1.4) actions and including the **Attari et al. Estimation Task (2.4)** to establish a baseline of participant bias. Item 4.1.6 also probes awareness of hallucination. Comparing perceived LLM accuracy patterns (Sec 4.1) to baseline human estimation patterns (Sec 2.4) will test H1.

2.  **RQ2 & H2a-c (Predictors: Numeracy, Energy Literacy, AI Literacy):**
    *   **Section 1 (Numeracy):** Uses the **Berlin Numeracy Test (4-item Traditional)** to objectively measure numeracy, addressing **H2a**.
    *   **Section 2 (Energy Literacy):** Uses selected items from the **DeWaters & Powers ELQ** covering Cognitive Knowledge (**2.1**), Affective Attitudes (**2.2**), and Behavioral aspects (**2.3**), providing the multidimensional measure needed. **Section 2.4 (Attari Estimation)** further assesses energy perception knowledge relevant to H2b. Cognitive knowledge items (**2.1**) are key for **H2b**.
    *   **Section 3 (AI Literacy):** Employs the validated **MAILS-Short form**, capturing facets like understanding, evaluation, and application, directly addressing **H2c**.

3.  **RQ3 & H3 (Beliefs/Trust -> Willingness/Frequency):**
    *   **Section 7 (LLM Use Intentions & Frequency):** Contains custom items measuring Willingness to Use (**7.1**) and Past Usage Frequency (**7.2**) *specifically for energy tasks*.
    *   These outcome variables will be predicted by scores from Section 4 (Beliefs) and Section 5 (Task-Specific Trust), directly testing **H3**.

4.  **RQ4 & H4 (Mediation/Moderation by General AI Trust/Distrust):**
    *   **Section 6 (General Trust & Distrust in AI):** Measures this using two validated approaches:
        *   The **TPA scale (6.1)** captures general trust and distrust facets.
        *   The **Semantic Differential Cognitive Trust scale (6.2)** provides a focused measure of cognitive aspects like reliability and competence.
    *   Scores from this section will be used in mediation/moderation analyses to test **H4**.

**Overall Structure & Feasibility:**

*   **Logical Flow:** The survey progresses from stable individual differences (Numeracy, Literacies) to specific LLM perceptions (Beliefs, Task-Specific Trust), then broader AI trust, and finally behavioral outcomes (Intentions/Frequency), concluding with demographics. This minimizes priming effects. Placing the Attari task within Energy Literacy allows assessment of baseline perceptions before LLM-specific questions.
*   **Validated Instruments:** Utilizes standard, validated scales where available (BNT, ELQ items, MAILS-Short, TPA, Shang & Hsieh Cognitive Trust).
*   **Custom Items:** Targeted custom items are included where validated scales are lacking for the specific context (LLM beliefs/trust/use *for energy tasks*). These items are designed based on theoretical constructs and formats from related literature.
*   **Runtime:** The instrument includes approximately 90 scored items (plus demographics). Estimating 15-20 seconds per item yields a total time of 22-30 minutes, fitting the target range. Using short forms (MAILS-Short, BNT-4, ELQ subset, Shang Cognitive subset) helps manage length.

**Conclusion:** This survey instrument provides a well-structured and comprehensive approach to measuring the required constructs. It integrates validated scales with necessary custom items, directly aligning with the RQs and Hs of the proposal, while remaining feasible for online administration.
