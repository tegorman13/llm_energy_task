## Justification Report

This survey instrument is meticulously constructed to operationalize the theoretical constructs central to the proposed study, drawing directly from the measurement approaches and validated scales discussed in the provided sources. The selection and ordering of items are designed to align with the study's research questions (RQs) and hypotheses (Hs) while maintaining a manageable cognitive load and runtime for participants in a survey-only format.

**Alignment with Research Questions (RQs):**

*   **RQ1: Prevailing lay beliefs concerning LLM accuracy and utility for energy tasks (estimation & planning) and differentiated trust.** This RQ is directly addressed by **Section 6 (Perceptions of LLM Accuracy and Utility)** and **Section 7 (Task-Specific Trust in LLMs)**.
    *   Section 6 contains custom-developed items using a 7-point Likert scale to capture subjective beliefs about the perceived accuracy and utility of LLMs for specific energy management functions, such as estimating appliance use, predicting savings from actions, understanding bills, and generating plans. The inclusion of perceived accuracy for both estimation and planning tasks allows for a direct examination of beliefs across these distinct functions, as required by RQ1.
    *   Section 7 employs custom items to assess task-specific trust, probing confidence and reliance specifically within the energy domain (e.g., trusting numerical estimates, technical advice, or personalized plans). By differentiating trust items across estimation, planning, and decision-support contexts, this section directly investigates whether lay trust is nuanced based on the specific energy task, fulfilling a key component of RQ1.

*   **RQ2: Predictive role of individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy) on lay beliefs.** This RQ examines how cognitive capacities and domain-specific knowledge influence perceptions of LLM capabilities.
    *   **Section 1 (Numeracy)** includes items adapted from the Berlin Numeracy Test, a standard instrument for assessing quantitative reasoning skills. Higher numeracy is hypothesized (H2a) to predict better-calibrated assessments of quantitative LLM outputs, particularly relevant for tasks involving energy units and savings calculations.
    *   **Section 2 (Energy Literacy: Cognitive Knowledge)** features multiple-choice questions adapted from the DeWaters & Powers ELQ, covering fundamental household energy concepts. This provides an objective measure of domain-specific knowledge. Higher cognitive energy literacy (H2b) is expected to correlate with more critical evaluation of LLM outputs, as domain expertise can inform the plausibility assessment of AI-generated information.
    *   **Section 3 (Energy Literacy: Affective and Behavioral)** complements the cognitive measure with items on environmental attitudes and self-reported conservation behaviors, drawing from ELQ and other established scales. While H2b primarily focuses on cognitive literacy for critical evaluation, the inclusion of affective and behavioral dimensions provides a more comprehensive understanding of energy literacy, consistent with its multidimensional conceptualization. These dimensions may also correlate with engagement with energy management topics and potentially beliefs about tools like LLMs.
    *   **Section 4 (AI Literacy: Self-Report)** utilizes the MAILS-Short, a validated self-report scale capturing various facets of AI literacy, including understanding, application, critical evaluation, and ethics. Higher scores on relevant MAILS dimensions (e.g., 'Evaluate AI', 'Understand AI') are hypothesized (H2c) to predict more cautious or nuanced beliefs about LLM capabilities, particularly awareness of limitations and potential inaccuracies.
    *   Statistical analysis will correlate scores from Sections 1, 2, 3 (subscales), and 4 with the belief scores from Section 6 to directly address RQ2.

*   **RQ3: Joint influence of perceived LLM accuracy and task-specific trust on willingness/frequency of use.** This RQ investigates the link between specific beliefs about LLM performance and intended/past behavior.
    *   **Section 6 (Perceived LLM Accuracy and Utility)** and **Section 7 (Task-Specific Trust in LLMs)** provide the predictor variables (perceived accuracy, perceived utility, task-specific trust).
    *   **Section 8 (LLM Usage Intentions and Frequency)** contains custom items assessing both self-reported past frequency of using LLMs for energy tasks and future willingness/intention to use them for these purposes. These items serve as the primary outcome variables for RQ3.
    *   Analysis will examine how perceived accuracy, utility, and task-specific trust (from Sections 6 and 7) collectively predict reported frequency and willingness to use LLMs for energy tasks (from Section 8), directly testing H3.

*   **RQ4: Mediation/Moderation role of general AI trust/distrust.** This RQ explores whether broader trust dispositions towards AI influence the relationship between task-specific beliefs and usage.
    *   **Section 5 (General Trust and Distrust in AI)** includes items adapted from the TPA-Revised, measuring general trust and distrust as separate constructs. This separation is crucial for exploring potentially distinct roles in the proposed mediation or moderation model.
    *   Scores from Section 5 will be incorporated into statistical models (e.g., mediation, moderation analyses) to examine how general trust and/or distrust influence the pathway from task-specific beliefs/trust (Sections 6, 7) to usage intentions/frequency (Section 8), addressing RQ4 and testing H4.

**Informing Hypotheses (Hs):**

*   **H1: Laypeople perceive LLMs as relatively accurate, but perceptions reflect human biases.** The perceived accuracy items in **Section 6** (specifically Q1-Q4) directly measure the first part of this hypothesis. High mean scores would support the idea of perceived relative accuracy. While the human behavioral estimation task (Attari et al., 2010) is excluded here, the design of Section 6 items, prompting perceptions for tasks known to be subject to human bias (e.g., appliance estimation, low vs. high impact savings), allows for comparing the pattern of *perceived* LLM accuracy to known patterns of *human* bias as documented by Attari et al. (2010) and Marghetis et al. (2019). For instance, if participants perceive LLMs as less accurate for estimating savings from low-impact actions compared to high-impact ones (mirroring the human tendency to overestimate the impact of curtailment), this would provide evidence for the latter part of H1.

*   **H2a: Higher numeracy correlates with better-calibrated assessment.** Numeracy scores from **Section 1** will be correlated with perceived accuracy ratings in **Section 6**, particularly for items involving quantitative estimation (Q1-Q3). Higher numeracy is expected to correlate with less extreme or potentially more nuanced accuracy perceptions.

*   **H2b: Higher energy literacy correlates with more critical/skeptical evaluation.** Cognitive energy literacy scores from **Section 2** are hypothesized to correlate negatively with perceived accuracy and task-specific trust scores in **Sections 6 and 7**. Affective and behavioral scores from **Section 3** may also show relationships, potentially influencing engagement or general disposition towards energy tools.

*   **H2c: Higher AI literacy correlates with more cautious/nuanced beliefs.** Scores from **Section 4 (MAILS-Short)**, particularly facets related to critical evaluation and understanding limitations, are expected to correlate negatively with perceived accuracy and trust in **Sections 6 and 7**, indicating a more cautious or skeptical appraisal.

*   **H3: Favorable beliefs (accuracy, trust) predict willingness to use.** Perceived accuracy, utility (Section 6), and task-specific trust (Section 7) scores are hypothesized to positively predict self-reported past frequency and future willingness to use LLMs for energy tasks (Section 8).

*   **H4: General trust mediates or moderates the relationship between specific beliefs and willingness/frequency.** General trust and distrust scores from **Section 5** will be analyzed as mediators or moderators in the relationship between specific beliefs/trust (Sections 6, 7) and usage (Section 8), as proposed by H4.

### Justification Report

**Introduction:**

This survey instrument has been constructed to empirically investigate lay perceptions regarding the accuracy and utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for household energy management tasks. Drawing upon theoretical constructs from cognitive psychology, particularly those related to judgment and decision-making under uncertainty, energy decision-making, various forms of literacy (numeracy, energy, AI), and human-AI trust calibration, the survey employs a combination of adapted validated measures and custom items. The goal is to collect quantitative data through self-report and objective knowledge questions to test the study's research questions and hypotheses within a manageable runtime.

**Alignment with Research Questions and Hypotheses:**

The survey is structured to directly address the proposed research questions and hypotheses as follows:

*   **RQ1: What are lay beliefs about the accuracy and utility of LLMs for household energy management tasks (e.g., estimating appliance energy use, creating conservation plans)?**
    *   Hypothesis H1 posits that users will overestimate LLM accuracy for energy tasks, potentially mirroring known human misperceptions rooted in cognitive heuristics [User Proposal H1]. The **"Lay Beliefs about LLM Accuracy and Utility for Energy Tasks"** section (Section 7) directly probes participants' subjective assessments of LLM capabilities for these specific tasks using Likert scale items. These items are custom-developed to target the domain-specific perceptions (e.g., accuracy of energy estimates, usefulness of conservation plans), which existing general AI trust or perception scales do not cover. By comparing these subjective beliefs to known human biases in energy estimation (documented by Attari et al., 2010), this section is foundational to testing H1 and addressing RQ1. The **"Task-Specific Trust in LLMs for Energy Tasks"** section (Section 8) further refines this by asking about trust specifically for various energy-related activities, providing a more granular measure of perceived utility and reliance in this domain.

*   **RQ2: How do individual differences in numeracy, energy literacy, and AI literacy predict these beliefs about LLM accuracy and utility?**
    *   Hypotheses H2a, H2b, and H2c predict that higher numeracy, energy literacy, and AI literacy, respectively, will correlate with potentially better-calibrated or more critical assessments of LLM performance [User Proposal H2a, H2b, H2c].
        *   **Numeracy:** The **"Individual Differences: Numeracy"** section (Section 3) employs items adapted from established numeracy assessments used in prior energy perception research (Attari et al., 2010; Marghetis et al., 2019). These items measure quantitative reasoning skills hypothesized to influence individuals' ability to evaluate the plausibility of energy-related figures or recommendations provided by an LLM, thus addressing H2a.
        *   **Energy Literacy:** The **"Individual Differences: Multidimensional Energy Literacy"** section (Section 4) captures cognitive knowledge, affective attitudes, and self-reported behaviors related to energy. The cognitive knowledge items (Section 4.1) are adapted from validated energy literacy questionnaires (DeWaters & Powers, 2011/2013) and draw on concepts from Attari et al. (2010) regarding appliance energy use knowledge. Affective attitudes (Section 4.2) and self-reported behaviors (Section 4.3) utilize Likert scales consistent with established measures (DeWaters & Powers, 2011/2013). This multidimensional assessment provides the data necessary to test how different facets of energy literacy relate to perceptions of LLM capabilities in the energy domain, addressing H2b.
        *   **AI Literacy:** The **"Individual Differences: AI Literacy"** section (Section 5) uses custom items designed to represent the key facets of the MAILS Short Form (Koch et al., 2024), an established self-report scale for general AI literacy. By covering areas like understanding, application, critical evaluation, and self-efficacy, this section provides a measure of perceived AI literacy relevant to understanding how individuals appraise AI systems, including LLMs. This assessment allows for testing H2c, examining how self-perceived AI literacy relates to beliefs about LLM performance for energy tasks.

*   **RQ3: Do perceived LLM accuracy and task-specific trust predict users' self-reported willingness and recent frequency of LLM use for energy-related decisions?**
    *   Hypothesis H3 states that perceived accuracy and trust will predict willingness to rely on these tools [User Proposal H3]. The **"LLM Usage Frequency and Willingness for Energy Tasks"** section (Section 10) includes custom items specifically asking about past usage frequency and future willingness to use LLMs *for household energy management tasks*. These items serve as the primary dependent variables for RQ3 and H3, assessed in relation to the measures of perceived accuracy (Section 7) and task-specific trust (Section 8).

*   **RQ4: Does general trust or distrust in AI mediate or moderate the relationship between beliefs about LLM accuracy/utility and willingness to use LLMs for energy-related decisions?**
    *   Hypothesis H4 explores the role of general AI trust [User Proposal H4]. The **"General Trust and Distrust in AI"** section (Section 6) includes custom items based on the facets of the TPA-Revised scale (Lai et al., 2024). This scale measures general dispositional trust and distrust in AI as separate constructs, which is crucial for investigating their potentially distinct roles as mediators or moderators in the relationship between task-specific beliefs (Sections 7, 8) and behavioral intention/usage (Section 10), addressing RQ4 and H4.

**Additional Constructs and Measures:**

*   **Attributional Beliefs:** The **"Attributional Beliefs about LLM Operations"** section (Section 9) includes custom items exploring participants' mental models of how LLMs acquire information, conceptually informed by prior work on AI perception (e.g., Chen et al., 2025). While not tied to a specific primary hypothesis, these exploratory items can provide valuable context for understanding the basis of perceived accuracy and trust, potentially revealing systematic misunderstandings about LLM capabilities and limitations that could influence critical evaluation and reliance.
*   **Demographics:** Standard demographic questions (Section 2) are included to describe the sample and allow for analyses of how these factors might relate to individual differences or perceptions.
*   **Data Quality and Feedback:** The inclusion of a data quality check (Section 11) and an open feedback section (Section 12) are standard practices in online survey methodology to identify potentially invalid responses and gather qualitative insights for refining future research.

**Construct Validity and Measurement Approach:**

The survey design prioritizes quantitative measures through Likert scales, multiple-choice questions, and open-ended numeric responses (for numeracy). While some measures are custom-written for domain specificity (Sections 7, 8, 9, 10), their construction is informed by the types of questions and constructs measured in validated scales (e.g., adapting trust item concepts to the energy domain). Where possible, measures are based on or adapted from validated instruments (Numeracy, Energy Literacy Knowledge/Attitudes/Behaviors, AI Literacy Facets, General Trust/Distrust Facets).

The use of self-report measures, while efficient for large samples in a survey format, is acknowledged to have limitations, such as social desirability bias or inaccuracies in recall. However, for assessing subjective beliefs (perceived accuracy, utility, trust), self-report is the most direct method. For behavioral frequency and intention, while experimental tasks offer higher ecological validity for actual behavior, self-report is the feasible approach within this survey design.

The selection of specific items and the development of custom questions have been guided by the need to precisely measure the variables outlined in the proposal and ensure they map onto the theoretical constructs and hypothesized relationships. For instance, capturing perceived accuracy for *specific* energy tasks rather than just general AI accuracy allows for a direct test of whether LLM perceptions mirror documented biases in *human* energy estimation (H1). Similarly, tailoring trust and usage questions to the energy domain ensures direct relevance to the core research questions.

Future validation steps for the custom measures (e.g., through pilot testing with cognitive interviews or psychometric evaluation in a dedicated study) would enhance the rigor of the instrument. However, for this initial study utilizing a survey-only design, the presented instrument provides a comprehensive and logically ordered approach to collect the necessary data to test the proposed hypotheses and address the research questions.

**Conclusion:**

The designed survey instrument aligns well with the study proposal's objectives. By incorporating measures of key individual differences and perceptions of LLMs specifically within the household energy management context, the survey is well-suited to investigate how cognitive factors and AI-related beliefs shape the perceived utility and potential adoption of LLMs for these tasks. The combination of adapted established measures and targeted custom items provides a robust foundation for empirically testing the proposed hypotheses regarding the role of numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy, and trust in shaping lay perceptions of LLMs in this novel domain.

The study addresses a critical intersection of cognitive biases in energy perception and the emerging role of AI in providing information and guidance. Research consistently demonstrates that individuals exhibit systematic misperceptions regarding household energy consumption and the effectiveness of various conservation actions, often relying on simplifying heuristics that lead to significant deviations from actual energy data. These biases include overestimating the impact of low-consumption activities (like turning off lights) and underestimating high-consumption activities (like heating/cooling or driving). Your proposal posits that LLMs, as potential information providers, may interact with these pre-existing cognitive structures. Understanding user perceptions of LLM capabilities in this domain is crucial for ensuring calibrated trust—where trust aligns with actual reliability—and mitigating potential harms from misapplying or over-relying on potentially inaccurate AI outputs.

Individual differences in cognitive abilities (numeracy), domain-specific knowledge (energy literacy), and technology understanding (AI literacy) are hypothesized to influence how users evaluate and trust information from LLMs. Numeracy is linked to better comprehension of quantitative data. Energy literacy, encompassing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, provides the domain expertise necessary for critically evaluating energy-related information. AI literacy, particularly understanding AI limitations and capabilities, is posited to influence how users assess the trustworthiness and applicability of AI-generated content. Finally, perceptions of LLM accuracy and trustworthiness are theorized to predict the willingness to adopt and use these tools for energy decisions, consistent with technology acceptance models.

The survey instrument below is constructed by selecting or adapting items from the provided sources to operationalize these constructs. Where no validated scale exists for a specific construct (e.g., perceived LLM accuracy for energy tasks), custom items are proposed, informed by the content and measurement approaches used in related research.

## Brief Justification Report

**Coverage of Research Questions**

* **RQ1 (Prevailing lay beliefs)** – Section A captures perceived *accuracy*, *utility*, and *task-specific trust* for both **estimation** and **planning** subtasks, mirroring the proposal’s dual focus. Items come directly from the most detailed drafts .

* **RQ2 (Individual-difference predictors)** – Sections D (MAILS), E (ELQ), and F (Numeracy) provide validated, multi-dimensional measures linked to cognitive psychology models of decision-making; their short-forms retain psychometric integrity while keeping run-time low.&#x20;

* **RQ3 (Accuracy + trust → use)** – Section B’s intention & behaviour items align with technology-acceptance frameworks and can be regressed on A-block scores to test joint influence.

* **RQ4 (General AI trust as mediator/moderator)** – Section C (TPA-R) supplies separate **trust** and **distrust** latent factors, enabling moderated-mediation analyses, as recommended in recent psychometric work.&#x20;

**Alignment with Hypotheses**

* **H1 (overall optimism & bias)** – Mean accuracy scores from A1 plus relative ratings on high- vs low-impact actions will reveal bias patterns.
* **H2a–c (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy)** – Simple correlations or SEM can test calibration vs scepticism predictions using Sections D–F.
* **H3 (beliefs → willingness)** – Path analysis from A-block through B-block confirms or disconfirms the directional expectation.
* **H4 (general trust mediates)** – Indirect‐effect tests with Section C scores quantify this pathway.

**Run-Time Estimate**

| Block        | Items | Time (s)                                |
| ------------ | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| Demo + Prior | 10    | 60                                      |
| Section A    | 11    | 90                                      |
| Section B    | 4     | 30                                      |
| Section C    | 8     | 50                                      |
| Section D    | 10    | 70                                      |
| Section E    | 16    | 120                                     |
| Section F    | 4     | 60                                      |
| **Total**    | 63    | **≈ 8 min median, 15 min conservative** |

**Why These Particular Items?**

* They are **validated short forms** (MAILS-Short, TPA-R, BNT-4, ELQ key items) or **domain-specific customs** mapped precisely to the proposal’s constructs.
* Redundancies across drafts were removed, but distinctive advantages (e.g., comparative utility item, hesitation reverse item) were retained to improve scale reliability (α > .80 expected) without inflating length.
* The ordering moves from less to more cognitively demanding material, limiting fatigue effects, and separates belief measures from intention measures to reduce consistency bias.

This consolidated instrument therefore provides the necessary data breadth with minimal respondent burden, fully supporting the planned hypothesis tests while remaining practical for large-sample online deployment.

# Introduction and Consent

Thank you for your interest in this study. We are researchers interested in understanding public perceptions regarding the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, for tasks related to household energy management.

**Study Purpose:** This study aims to understand people's beliefs about the accuracy, usefulness, and trustworthiness of LLMs for estimating home appliance energy use and creating personalized energy conservation plans. We are also interested in how individual differences in areas like energy knowledge, AI familiarity, and numeracy relate to these beliefs.

**Procedure:** This online survey involves answering questions about your background, your familiarity and attitudes towards AI and energy, your beliefs about LLM capabilities for specific energy tasks, and some reasoning questions. There are no right or wrong answers to the opinion questions; we are interested in your genuine perceptions. The survey is expected to take approximately **20-25 minutes** to complete.

**Confidentiality:** Your responses will be kept confidential and anonymous. Data will be aggregated for analysis, and no personally identifiable information will be reported in any publications or presentations resulting from this study.

**Voluntary Participation:** Your participation is completely voluntary. You may skip any question you do not wish to answer (unless marked as required for study flow) and you may withdraw from the study at any time by simply closing your browser window. If you withdraw before completion, your partial responses will not be used.

# Justification Report

This report outlines how the constructed survey instrument addresses the research questions (RQs) and informs the hypotheses (H) presented in the study proposal.

## Addressing Research Questions (RQs)

  * **RQ1: Prevailing lay beliefs concerning LLM accuracy and utility for energy tasks (estimation & planning) and differentiated trust.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Primarily addressed by sections "[Beliefs about LLMs for Energy Estimation (Task A)](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23beliefs-about-llms-for-energy-estimation-task-a)" and "[Beliefs about LLMs for Energy Planning (Task B)](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23beliefs-about-llms-for-energy-planning-task-b)".
      * **Justification:** These sections contain custom items specifically designed to measure perceived accuracy (Q4, Q5, Q8, Q10, Q11), perceived utility (Q7, Q15), and task-specific trustworthiness (Q6, Q13, Q14) for both appliance energy estimation (Task A) and personalized plan generation (Task B). Questions Q9 and Q16 probe underlying mental models related to how LLMs might perform these tasks. The distinct sections for Task A and Task B allow for analysis of how beliefs differ between providing specific factual/quantitative information versus generating comprehensive, personalized plans, directly addressing the second part of RQ1. Items Q6 and Q13 specifically measure trust differentiated by task.

  * **RQ2: Predictive role of individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy) on lay beliefs.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Requires correlating scores from "[Energy Literacy](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23energy-literacy)", "[AI Literacy](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23ai-literacy)", and "[Numeracy](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23numeracy)" sections with the belief scores derived from the Task A and Task B sections.
      * **Justification:** The survey includes validated instruments or representative items to measure objective numeracy (Berlin Numeracy Test, Q80-Q83), multidimensional energy literacy (Cognitive, Affective, Behavioral subsets from DeWaters & Powers, Q17-Q30), and AI literacy (MAILS-Short Form, Q31-Q40). Statistical analysis (e.g., correlation, regression) of scores from these sections against the perceived accuracy, utility, and trust scores from the Task A/B sections will directly assess the predictive relationships proposed in RQ2.

  * **RQ3: Joint influence of perceived LLM accuracy and task-specific trust on willingness/frequency of use.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links belief scores from Task A/B sections (e.g., Q4, Q5, Q6, Q10, Q11, Q13) with the outcome measures in "[Willingness and Frequency of Use](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23willingness-and-frequency-of-use)" (Q84-Q87).
      * **Justification:** The survey measures perceived accuracy (Q4, Q5, Q10, Q11) and task-specific trust (Q6, Q13) for both energy tasks. It also includes custom items assessing self-reported willingness to use LLMs for these tasks in the future (Q84, Q85, Q86) and self-reported frequency of past use (Q87). Analyzing how accuracy and trust perceptions jointly predict willingness and frequency scores (e.g., using regression models) directly addresses RQ3.

  * **RQ4: Mediation/Moderation role of general AI trust/distrust.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Utilizes scores from "[General Trust in AI](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23general-trust-in-ai)" (TPA items Q41-Q52; Semantic Differential items Q53-Q79) in relation to the pathway identified in RQ3 (specific beliefs -\> willingness/frequency).
      * **Justification:** The survey includes established measures for general trust (TPA captures factors like reliability, confidence, integrity) and distrust (TPA also includes items on deceptiveness, suspicion; the Semantic Differential scale captures broader cognitive and affective trust/distrust dimensions). Statistical mediation and moderation analyses can be performed using scores from this section to examine whether general trust/distrust influences the relationship between task-specific beliefs (from Task A/B sections) and use intentions/behavior (from Willingness/Frequency section), as proposed in RQ4.

## Informing Hypotheses (H)

  * **H1: Laypeople perceive LLMs as relatively accurate, but perceptions reflect human biases.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Primarily informed by belief ratings in Task A (Q4, Q5) and potentially Task B (Q10). Comparison with objective accuracy or expert benchmarks (external data) would be needed, but the *perception* of accuracy is measured. Item Q8 (likelihood of significant error) also informs this. Items related to Attari et al.'s estimation task within Energy Literacy (if included in a task-based version) or custom items probing bias perception (like Q9, Q16) can explore the second part of H1.
      * **Justification:** High mean scores on perceived accuracy items (Q4, Q5, Q10) would support the first part of H1. Analyzing patterns in perceived accuracy across different appliance types (if measured more granularly) or through specific bias perception items could provide evidence regarding the reflection of human biases (e.g., if LLMs are perceived as less accurate for high-energy vs. low-energy items).

  * **H2a: Higher numeracy correlates with better-calibrated assessment.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links Numeracy scores (Q80-Q83) with the *variability or extremity* of accuracy ratings in Task A (Q4, Q5, Q8).
      * **Justification:** This hypothesis predicts a relationship between numeracy skills and the nature (less extreme, potentially more accurate *if objective data were available*) of accuracy beliefs for quantitative tasks. Analysis will involve correlating numeracy scores with the mean, variance, or extremity of responses to quantitative accuracy perception items.

  * **H2b: Higher energy literacy correlates with more critical/skeptical evaluation.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links Energy Literacy scores (Q17-Q30, especially cognitive Q17-Q22) with belief ratings in Task A and Task B (particularly accuracy Q4, Q5, Q10, Q11 and trust Q6, Q13).
      * **Justification:** This hypothesis predicts that domain knowledge (energy literacy) enables more critical assessment. Analysis will involve correlating energy literacy scores with perceived accuracy and trust, expecting negative correlations (higher literacy -\> lower perceived accuracy/trust, i.e., more skepticism).

  * **H2c: Higher AI literacy correlates with more cautious/nuanced beliefs.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links AI Literacy scores (MAILS-Short, Q31-Q40, esp. items on understanding limitations/ethics like Q35, Q40) with belief ratings (Task A/B) and general trust (TPA/Semantic Differential).
      * **Justification:** Higher scores on MAILS facets related to critical evaluation (e.g., Understand AI, AI Ethics) are expected to correlate with lower perceived accuracy/trust (more caution). High scores on Use & Apply facets might correlate positively, as hypothesized. This allows testing the association between understanding AI limitations and specific beliefs about LLMs in the energy context.

  * **H3: Favorable beliefs (accuracy, trust) predict willingness to use.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links Task A/B belief scores (Q4-Q7, Q10-Q15) with Willingness/Frequency scores (Q84-Q87).
      * **Justification:** This hypothesis predicts a direct positive relationship. Correlations and regressions between perceived accuracy, utility, task-specific trust, and willingness/frequency items will test this directly.

  * **H4: General trust mediates the relationship between specific beliefs and willingness/frequency.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Uses General Trust scores (TPA, Semantic Differential) as a mediator in the relationship tested for H3.
      * **Justification:** The survey measures both specific beliefs (Task A/B sections) and general AI trust/distrust. Mediation analysis can test the proposed pathway: Specific Beliefs -\> General Trust -\> Willingness/Frequency.

In conclusion, the survey instrument is structured to gather data pertinent to each research question by including validated scales for individual differences and general trust, alongside custom-developed items targeting the specific lay beliefs and behavioral intentions relevant to LLMs in the household energy domain. The selection and ordering are designed to be logical while aiming for a manageable run-time for participants.

## Justification Report

This survey instrument is designed to address the research questions and hypotheses outlined in the proposal.

**Addressing RQ1 & H1 (Lay Beliefs about LLMs for Energy Tasks):**

*   **Section 2 (Perceptions of LLMs for Energy Tasks):** This section uses custom-designed Likert scale items to directly measure lay beliefs about the **Accuracy** (Items 1.1-1.6), **Utility** (Items 2.1-2.5), and **Task-Specific Trust** (Items 3.1-3.5) of current LLMs for specific household energy management functions.
*   **Accuracy items (1.3 vs. 1.4)** are structured to probe potential biases mirroring human misperceptions (Attari et al., 2010), allowing a test of **H1**. For example, comparing perceived accuracy for high-impact efficiency actions (1.3) vs. low-impact curtailment actions (1.4).
*   The distinction between items focusing on **factual information** (e.g., 1.1, 3.1) versus **personalized planning/estimation** (e.g., 1.6, 2.4, 3.5) directly addresses the latter part of **RQ1**.

**Addressing RQ2 & H2a, H2b, H2c (Role of Individual Differences):**

*   **Section 8 (Objective Numeracy):** Measures objective numeracy using validated BNT/CRT items (Marghetis et al., 2019). These scores will be correlated with the custom perception items from Section 2 to test **H2a**.
*   **Section 5 (Energy Literacy - Affective & Behavioral) & Section 7 (Energy Literacy - Cognitive):** The ELQ (DeWaters & Powers, 2011) provides multidimensional measures. The objective cognitive score from Section 7 will be used to test **H2b** by examining its correlation with skepticism/accuracy perceptions in Section 2. Affective/Behavioral scores serve as covariates or further exploratory variables.
*   **Section 6 (AI Literacy - Self-Report):** The MAILS-Short (Koch et al., 2024) measures perceived AI literacy facets. Scores on facets related to understanding limitations and critical evaluation will be correlated with the custom perception items (Section 2) to test **H2c**.

**Addressing RQ3 & H3 (Perceptions, Trust -> Intentions/Usage):**

*   **Section 3 (LLM Usage Intentions and Frequency):** Custom items measure **Willingness to Use/Reliance Intentions** (Items 4.1-4.5) and **Past Usage Frequency** (Item 5.1) specifically for energy tasks.
*   These outcome variables (Section 3) will be regressed on the predictor variables from Section 2 (Perceived Accuracy, Perceived Utility, Task-Specific Trust) to test **H3**.

**Addressing RQ4 & H4 (Role of General AI Trust):**

*   **Section 4 (General Trust and Distrust in AI):** Measures general AI trust/distrust using two validated scales:
    *   **TPA (Jian et al., 2000):** A standard measure capturing core trust/distrust facets (competence, integrity, etc.).
    *   **Shang & Hsieh (2025) Semantic Differential:** Explicitly measures cognitive and affective dimensions of trust.
*   These general trust scores will be incorporated into mediation/moderation models. **H4** (mediation) will be tested by examining if the relationship between specific beliefs (Section 2) and willingness/frequency (Section 3) is significantly carried through general trust scores (Section 4). Moderation analyses can also explore if general trust alters the strength of the belief-intention link.

**Overall Structure & Runtime:**

The survey flows logically from specific perceptions of LLMs for energy tasks, to usage intentions/frequency, then to broader constructs like general AI trust and individual literacies, before concluding with objective tests and demographics. This structure aims to keep related concepts together and places more demanding objective tests later. The selection prioritizes validated scales where available (ELQ, MAILS-Short, TPA, Shang et al., BNT/CRT) and uses custom items for the core novel constructs (LLM energy perceptions/trust/use). While the ELQ Cognitive section (33 items) and Shang scale (27 items) are relatively long, the overall number of items (~148) should be manageable within the 20-25 minute target, assuming efficient electronic administration. If piloting indicates excessive length, shortening the ELQ Cognitive or Shang scales could be considered.

## Justification Report for Final Survey Draft

This final survey draft integrates the most pertinent measures from the corpus and previous drafts to comprehensively address the research proposal's objectives within a feasible timeframe (estimated 20-25 minutes).

**Rationale for Structure and Flow:**

1.  **Consent & Intro:** Standard ethical start.
2.  **Energy Perceptions (Part 1 - Attari et al.):** Placed early to capture baseline *human* energy misperceptions *before* extensive priming with AI concepts. This is crucial for testing H1 (comparing human biases to perceived LLM accuracy). Using the established relative estimation format provides a direct link to prior literature.
3.  **AI/LLM Familiarity (Part 2):** Basic questions establish prior experience, serving as important control variables.
4.  **LLM Beliefs (Part 3 - Custom):** This core section directly measures the dependent variables for RQ1 and H1 (perceived accuracy, utility) and a key predictor for RQ3 (task-specific trust) regarding LLMs *for energy tasks*. Items are designed to probe accuracy for different task types (factual, estimation, planning) and specific biases (low vs. high impact actions).
5.  **LLM Usage (Part 4 - Custom):** Measures the key outcome variables (willingness/intention, past frequency) for RQ3 and H4, specifically focused on the energy domain. Placed after specific beliefs to assess potential influence.
6.  **General AI Trust (Part 5 - TPA):** Measures general dispositional trust/distrust using the standard TPA scale (Jian et al., 2000). Placed after LLM-specific beliefs to allow testing mediation/moderation effects (RQ4, H4). The full TPA is used for comprehensive coverage of trust/distrust facets.
7.  **Energy Literacy (Part 6 - ELQ Adaptation):** Measures the multidimensional construct (Cognitive, Affective, Behavioral) central to RQ2 and H2b. The cognitive section uses selected, validated multiple-choice items for objective knowledge. Affective and Behavioral sections use selected Likert items. Placed later as it's a distinct individual difference measure.
8.  **AI Literacy (Part 7 - MAILS-Short):** Uses the validated short form to measure self-perceived AI literacy facets relevant to RQ2 and H2c. Placed after energy literacy.
9.  **Objective Numeracy (Part 8 - BNT/CRT):** Measures objective quantitative reasoning skills relevant to RQ2 and H2a. Placed later in the survey as it requires more cognitive effort. Using a mix of BNT/CRT items provides robust assessment.
10. **Demographics (Part 9):** Standard placement at the end.
11. **Conclusion/Debriefing (Part 10):** Standard closing.

**Rationale for Instrument/Item Selection:**

*   **Perceived LLM Accuracy/Utility/Trust (Part 3):** Custom items are essential as no standard scales exist for this specific application domain. Items were carefully crafted based on proposal RQs, H1 (bias testing), and previous drafts, ensuring coverage of estimation vs. planning accuracy/utility/trust.
*   **Energy Perceptions (Part 1):** Using the Attari et al. (2010) relative estimation format provides a validated method to capture baseline human energy misperceptions, directly informing H1.
*   **Numeracy (Part 8):** Uses standard, objective BNT/CRT items frequently paired with energy perception research (Marghetis et al., 2019). The 4-item selection balances rigor and brevity.
*   **Energy Literacy (Part 6):** Uses selected items from the well-established ELQ framework (DeWaters & Powers, 2011) to capture the required multidimensionality (Cognitive, Affective, Behavioral) efficiently. The 6 MC cognitive items cover core concepts. The 4 Affective and 4 Behavioral items capture key attitudes and self-reported actions.
*   **AI Literacy (Part 7):** Uses the validated MAILS-Short (Koch et al., 2024), directly aligning with the proposal and offering a concise, multidimensional self-report measure.
*   **General AI Trust (Part 5):** Uses the full TPA (Jian et al., 2000), a standard instrument in HRI/automation trust, providing comprehensive data on trust/distrust facets needed for RQ4/H4. Although the Shang scale measures cognitive/affective trust explicitly, the TPA is more standard for general trust/distrust and using both would significantly increase length. TPA's factors implicitly cover cognitive aspects (competence, reliability) and some affective elements (wary, suspicious).
*   **LLM Usage (Part 4):** Custom items directly measure the specific outcome variables (willingness, frequency) for energy tasks needed for RQ3/H4.

**Addressing RQs and Hypotheses:**

*   **RQ1/H1:** Addressed by Part 3 (LLM Beliefs) and comparison with Part 1 (Human Perceptions).
*   **RQ2/H2a, H2b, H2c:** Addressed by correlating Part 8 (Numeracy), Part 6 (Energy Literacy), and Part 7 (AI Literacy) with Part 3 (LLM Beliefs).
*   **RQ3/H3:** Addressed by analyzing the relationship between Part 3 (LLM Beliefs/Trust) and Part 4 (LLM Usage).
*   **RQ4/H4:** Addressed by incorporating Part 5 (General AI Trust) into the analysis of the relationship identified for RQ3.

**Feasibility:** The survey contains approximately 88 scored items (excluding intro/demo). With an estimated 15-20 seconds per item, the total time is around 22-29 minutes, fitting the target range. The mix of item types (MC, Likert, slider, open-numeric) adds variety. Validated short forms are used where possible to balance rigor and brevity. This final draft provides a comprehensive yet feasible instrument to address the study's goals.

**(End of Survey)**

## **Justification Report**

**1\. Introduction**

This report details the construction and rationale behind the survey instrument designed to explore the relationships between AI literacy, trust in AI, numeracy, and energy literacy. The primary goal is to gather data that allows for an analysis of how these constructs interact within a general population sample. The survey employs established scales where available and appropriate, supplemented by custom demographic questions. The structure and item selection prioritize validity, reliability, and respondent burden, aiming for a completion time of approximately 15-20 minutes.

**2\. Overall Structure and Flow**

The survey is organized into distinct sections to ensure clarity and logical progression for the respondent. It begins with an **Introduction and Consent** form, outlining the study's purpose, ensuring voluntary participation, and guaranteeing confidentiality, adhering to ethical research standards.

**Section A: Demographics** follows, collecting essential background information (age, gender, education, employment). These variables are crucial for understanding the sample composition and for analyzing potential group differences in the main constructs of interest. Optional questions about field of study/occupation and technology usage provide further context.

**Section B: AI Literacy** utilizes the MAILS-Short scale. Placing this section early allows for gauging the respondent's self-perceived understanding and skills related to AI before delving into trust perceptions. This placement helps establish a baseline of AI familiarity.

**Section C: Trust in AI** employs a revised version of the Trust in Automation Scale (TPA). This section logically follows the AI literacy assessment, allowing respondents to reflect on their general trust and distrust towards AI systems based on their understanding. The use of separate trust and distrust subscales, as recommended by recent psychometric evaluations, provides a more nuanced measure than a single bipolar scale.

**Section D: Numeracy** introduces the Berlin Numeracy Test (Short Version). This section requires focused cognitive effort and is placed mid-survey to avoid potential fatigue effects influencing performance if placed at the very end. Numeracy skills are relevant as they may influence how individuals process information related to AI capabilities or energy statistics.

**Section E: Energy Literacy** uses selected items from the Energy Literacy Questionnaire (ELQ). This section assesses knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to energy. Placing it later allows for a shift in topic focus after the more abstract AI and numeracy sections.

Finally, a **Conclusion** thanks participants for their time and contribution. This flow aims to maintain respondent engagement and minimize potential carryover effects between unrelated constructs.

**3\. Scale Selection and Rationale**

The selection of measurement instruments was guided by the need for validated, reliable, and contextually appropriate scales, while also considering the overall survey length.

* **AI Literacy (MAILS-Short):** The Meta-Artificial Intelligence Literacy Scale (MAILS) provides a comprehensive framework covering various facets of AI literacy, including understanding, application, ethics, and self-perceived competence. The short version (MAILS-Short) offers a practical, 10-item measure suitable for survey research, demonstrated to have good model fit. It captures the user's self-assessment of their ability to interact with, understand, and critically evaluate AI systems.  
* **Trust in AI (TPA \- Revised):** The Trust in (Automation) Scale (TPA) is a widely used measure in human-automation interaction research. Recent studies specifically examining its psychometric properties in the context of AI suggest that the original single-factor structure performs poorly. Instead, a two-factor model distinguishing between **Trust** (items reflecting confidence, reliability, dependability) and **Distrust** (items reflecting suspicion, wariness, concern) shows better validity and reliability. This distinction is crucial as trust and distrust may function as separate constructs rather than opposite ends of a single spectrum. The survey adopts this validated two-factor structure, using the specific items identified as loading onto these factors , without reverse-scoring the distrust items, as recommended. This approach allows for a more nuanced measurement of the user's relationship with AI, acknowledging that one might simultaneously hold feelings of trust and distrust.  
* **Numeracy (Berlin Numeracy Test \- Short):** Numeracy, particularly the ability to understand probabilities and statistical information (risk literacy), is increasingly relevant in a data-driven world and influences decision-making in various contexts. The Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT) is a well-validated instrument designed to measure this construct. The 4-item paper-and-pencil version provides a quick yet effective assessment of statistical reasoning and risk literacy, shown to be a strong predictor of comprehension in various domains. Its inclusion allows for examining how numerical ability relates to understanding and trust in complex systems like AI or interpreting energy-related data.  
* **Energy Literacy (ELQ \- Selected Items):** The Energy Literacy Questionnaire (ELQ) developed by DeWaters and Powers is a comprehensive tool assessing the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of energy literacy. Given the survey length constraints, a selection of items representing each dimension was chosen based on their relevance and coverage of key energy concepts (e.g., sources, conservation, environmental impact) as identified in the original instrument development and validation studies. This selection aims to capture the core aspects of energy literacy without overburdening respondents. The distinction between cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions is maintained, as research suggests these components relate differently to each other and to outcomes.

**4\. Item Selection (Energy Literacy Questionnaire)**

The ELQ originally contains 56 items. To ensure a manageable survey length, a subset of 15 items was selected, aiming to represent the three core dimensions:

* **Cognitive (4 items):** Chosen to cover fundamental knowledge about energy sources (renewable vs. non-renewable), primary energy use areas (home consumption), dominant energy sources (national level), and key environmental impacts (climate change causes). These items provide a basic assessment of factual understanding.  
* **Affective (6 items):** Selected to gauge attitudes towards energy conservation importance, personal responsibility, trust in technological solutions versus conservation, and willingness to support pro-environmental policies or accept trade-offs. These items reflect underlying values and beliefs driving energy-related decisions.  
* **Behavioral (5 items):** Focus on self-reported frequency of common energy-saving actions (lights, computer use, water conservation, transportation) and willingness to influence others, providing an indicator of practical engagement with energy conservation.

This selection balances breadth across the dimensions with the need for brevity, focusing on items with broad applicability and relevance.

**5\. Formatting and Usability**

The survey is formatted using Pandoc Markdown for clarity and ease of deployment across different platforms. Each section is clearly demarcated with headings. Instructions are provided for each question type (e.g., Likert scale anchors, multiple-choice instructions). The use of established scales with clear response formats (Likert scales, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank for BNT) enhances usability and data quality.

**6\. Estimated Completion Time**

Based on the number and type of questions in each section, the estimated completion time is between 11 and 17 minutes. This duration is considered reasonable for online surveys and aims to maximize completion rates while minimizing respondent fatigue.

**7\. Addressing Research Questions/Hypotheses**

The selected measures and their arrangement allow for the investigation of several key research questions:

* **Baseline Levels:** The survey will provide descriptive statistics on the levels of AI literacy (MAILS-Short), trust and distrust in AI (TPA-Revised), numeracy (BNT), and the three dimensions of energy literacy (ELQ subscales) within the sample.  
* **AI Literacy and Trust:** By correlating MAILS-Short scores with TPA-Trust and TPA-Distrust scores, the relationship between understanding AI and trusting (or distrusting) it can be examined. It allows exploration of whether higher perceived literacy leads to more calibrated trust (i.e., appropriate levels of trust and distrust based on context) or potentially increased skepticism.  
* **Numeracy's Role:** Correlating BNT scores with MAILS-Short and TPA scores will help understand if numerical ability influences how people perceive and trust AI. Higher numeracy might correlate with a better grasp of AI's probabilistic nature, potentially affecting trust levels. Similarly, numeracy's link to energy literacy (especially the cognitive component) can be assessed.  
* **Interplay of Constructs:** The survey facilitates exploring the complex interplay between these variables. For example, does trust in AI influence the acceptance of AI-driven energy solutions? Is energy-saving behavior (ELQ-Behavioral) predicted more strongly by energy-related attitudes (ELQ-Affective) or knowledge (ELQ-Cognitive), and how do AI literacy and trust modify these relationships? Research suggests affect and behavior are often more strongly linked than knowledge and behavior in the energy domain.  
* **Demographic Influences:** Analyzing responses across different demographic groups (age, education, etc.) will reveal potential variations in literacy, trust, and behaviors, providing valuable insights for targeted communication or educational strategies.

In conclusion, this survey instrument, combining established and adapted scales, is designed to gather comprehensive data on AI literacy, trust, numeracy, and energy literacy. The structure and item selection are informed by psychometric principles and existing research, aiming to provide reliable and valid data for exploring the relationships between these critical constructs within a manageable survey length. The inclusion of distinct trust and distrust measures and the multi-dimensional assessment of energy literacy allows for a nuanced analysis of public perceptions and behaviors related to technology and sustainability.

# Justification Report

## Alignment with Research Questions and Hypotheses

**RQ1: Prevailing lay beliefs about LLM accuracy and utility for energy estimation and planning.**

- *Sections 6 \& 7* directly measure perceived accuracy, utility, and trust in LLMs for both factual energy estimation and personalized planning, using custom items that mirror the structure of Attari et al. (2010) and the proposal’s focus on curtailment vs. efficiency[^3][^6].
- The inclusion of both estimation (appliance use, savings from actions) and planning (personalized plans) enables direct comparison of beliefs across task types, as required by RQ1 and H1.

**RQ2: Prediction of beliefs by individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy).**

- *Sections 3–5* use validated, multi-item scales: Berlin Numeracy Test[^3][^4], DeWaters \& Powers (2011) Energy Literacy (cognitive, affective, behavioral)[^3][^10], and MAILS-Short for AI literacy[^3][^9].
- These measures allow for robust correlational and regression analyses to test whether higher literacy/numeracy predicts more calibrated or critical beliefs about LLMs (H2a–H2c).

**RQ3: How perceptions of LLM accuracy and trust predict willingness to use LLMs for energy decisions.**

- *Sections 6, 7, and 9* capture perceived LLM accuracy, task-specific trust, and both past and intended use for energy tasks, providing the necessary variables to test H3 (e.g., mediation/structural models linking beliefs and trust to use intentions/frequency).

**RQ4: Mediation/moderation by general trust/distrust in AI.**

- *Section 8* includes the TPA (Jian et al., 2000) and the cognitive subscale of the Semantic Differential AI-Trust scale (Shang \& Hsieh, 2025), both validated and widely used[^3][^6].
- This enables testing whether general trust in AI mediates or moderates the relationship between specific LLM beliefs and use intentions (H4).


## Survey Construction Strengths

- **Item selection:** Draws on gold-standard, validated measures for all individual difference constructs, ensuring reliability and comparability with prior work[^3][^4][^9][^10].
- **Custom items:** Where no validated scale exists (e.g., LLM accuracy/utility for energy tasks), items are closely modeled on established measurement approaches (Attari et al., 2010; DeWaters \& Powers, 2011) and pilot-tested in related studies[^3][^10].
- **Task-specificity:** LLM perception and trust items are explicitly tied to energy estimation and planning, not generic AI, directly addressing the proposal’s focus.
- **Logical flow:** The order moves from background/demographics to individual differences, then to LLM perceptions, trust, and finally behavioral intentions, minimizing priming and cognitive fatigue[^3][^4][^5][^6].
- **Feasibility:** The total item count and estimated time (20–25 minutes) are appropriate for online administration and participant retention[^3][^4].


## Coverage of Hypotheses

- **H1:** Directly testable by comparing perceived LLM accuracy for curtailment vs. efficiency actions (Section 6).
- **H2a–c:** Individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy) can be modeled as predictors of LLM belief calibration and criticality (Sections 3–5, 6).
- **H3:** Regression/mediation models can link LLM-specific accuracy/trust beliefs to use intentions/frequency (Sections 6, 7, 9).
- **H4:** General AI trust (Section 8) can be tested as a mediator/moderator in the above relationships.

**In summary:**
This survey instrument integrates the best validated scales and custom items from multiple drafts and the literature, ensuring comprehensive, reliable, and targeted measurement of all constructs required by the research questions and hypotheses. The structure and content are well justified by both the theoretical framework and empirical precedent[^3][^4][^6][^9][^10].

## Justification Report

The survey instrument delineated above is meticulously constructed to operationalize the constructs central to your proposal, aiming to investigate the complex interplay between individual cognitive characteristics, established energy perception biases, AI literacy, trust dynamics, and the perceived capabilities and adoption potential of LLMs for household energy management. Drawing upon principles from cognitive psychology, decision-making under uncertainty, and human-AI interaction literature, the design aligns directly with the proposed research questions and hypotheses (RQ1-RQ4, H1-H4).

**Alignment with Research Questions and Hypotheses:**

The instrument is structured to address each research question and test the associated hypotheses:

*   **RQ1: Lay beliefs about LLM accuracy and utility for energy tasks; differentiation of trust for specific tasks.** This question is primarily addressed by **Section 3.3 (Perceived LLM Accuracy & Utility)** and **Section 3.4 (Task-Specific Trust in LLMs for Energy Tasks)**.
    *   **H1** posits that lay perceptions of LLM accuracy will mirror known human biases in energy estimation (e.g., overestimating low-impact, underestimating high-impact activities) (Attari et al., 2010; Marghetis et al., 2019). While this survey version *excludes* the behavioral estimation task that directly measures human bias, the custom items in Section 3.3 are *designed* to probe perceptions of LLM accuracy for tasks (e.g., appliance estimation, savings estimation) where these biases are known to occur in human judgment. Future analysis will compare aggregated perceived LLM accuracy patterns to documented human biases to test this hypothesis, as recommended in the survey design notes (Survey Drafts All). The inclusion of custom items is necessitated by the absence of pre-established scales specifically measuring perceived LLM capability in the energy domain (Survey Eval; Survey Sums All; Gemini App responses).
    *   Section 3.3 also includes items on perceived *utility* for various energy tasks (e.g., understanding bills, creating plans), directly addressing the "utility" component of RQ1.
    *   Section 3.4, with its custom items on task-specific trust, directly probes whether users differentiate their trust in LLMs for distinct energy functions like estimation versus planning, as specified in RQ1 (Survey Drafts All; Gemini App responses).

*   **RQ2: Influence of individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy) on lay beliefs about LLM capabilities.** This question is addressed by the measures in **Section 2 (Individual Differences)** as predictors of responses in Section 3.3 and 3.4.
    *   **H2a** predicts that higher objective numeracy is associated with better-calibrated beliefs about LLM quantitative capabilities. **Section 2.1 (Numeracy)** employs basic quantitative reasoning items adapted from prior energy perception research (Attari et al., 2010; Marghetis et al., 2019). While not the full Berlin Numeracy Test, these items provide a measure of quantitative skill relevant to evaluating numerical energy information (Survey Drafts All).
    *   **H2b** suggests that higher energy literacy, particularly cognitive knowledge, leads to more critical evaluation of LLM outputs. **Section 2.2 (Energy Literacy: Cognitive Knowledge)** uses multiple-choice items adapted from the ELQ (DeWaters & Powers, 2011/2013; Canfield et al., 2017) covering fundamental household energy concepts. This provides an objective measure of domain knowledge, hypothesized to enable individuals to identify potentially implausible LLM suggestions (Proposal discussion; Survey Drafts All). The affective (Section 2.3) and behavioral (Section 2.4) subscales of energy literacy are included as important multidimensional components that may also relate to engagement with energy information, consistent with the ELQ's structure (DeWaters & Powers, 2011/2013; Survey Drafts All).
    *   **H2c** links higher AI literacy, especially critical evaluation facets, to more nuanced beliefs about LLM capabilities. **Section 2.5 (AI Literacy)** utilizes items from the MAILS-Short (Koch et al., 2024), a validated self-report scale covering multiple AI literacy dimensions, including understanding, critical evaluation, and self-efficacy (MAILS reference from Survey Eval; Survey Drafts All). This measure assesses perceived AI literacy hypothesized to mitigate uncritical acceptance of AI outputs (Proposal discussion; Survey Drafts All).

*   **RQ3: Influence of perceived LLM accuracy and task-specific trust on willingness and frequency of LLM use for energy tasks.** This is addressed by responses in **Section 3.3, 3.4, and Section 4 (LLM Usage for Energy Tasks)**.
    *   **H3** posits that favorable beliefs regarding accuracy and trustworthiness are positively associated with willingness to use LLMs for energy decisions. Responses to Section 3.3 and 3.4 are intended to predict responses in **Section 4.1 (Willingness to Use)** and **Section 4.2 (Past Frequency of Use)**. Custom items are used in Section 4 because general AI usage scales lack the necessary specificity to energy tasks (Gemini App responses; Survey Drafts All). This aligns with technology acceptance models where perceived usefulness and ease of use (proxied here by accuracy/utility and trust) drive behavioral intentions (Chen & Zhao, 2025 reference in Proposal).

*   **RQ4: Role of general trust/distrust in AI as mediator or moderator.** This is addressed by measures in **Section 3.1 (General Trust and Distrust in AI)** in relation to the pathways examined in RQ3.
    *   **H4** hypothesizes that general trust in AI mediates the positive relationship between favorable specific beliefs/task-specific trust and usage willingness/frequency. **Section 3.1** includes items adapted from the TPA-Revised (Lai et al., 2024), capturing general trust and distrust as distinct constructs (Survey Eval; Survey Drafts All). Measuring both trust and distrust separately is crucial for investigating potentially different mediating or moderating effects (Lai et al., 2024; Survey Drafts All). This allows for examining whether believing an LLM is effective for energy tasks influences broader AI trust, which in turn affects usage intentions, or whether general trust/distrust simply shapes how task-specific beliefs translate into behavior.

**Additional Considerations:**

**Section 3.2 (Attributional Beliefs about LLMs)** includes custom items probing potential user mental models of LLM operation (e.g., access to data, potential for error, capacity for personalization). While not tied to a specific hypothesis in the provided proposal summary, these items provide valuable explanatory data for *why* users hold certain beliefs about accuracy and utility, connecting to the literature on user mental models of AI (Buçinca et al., 2021 reference in Proposal). Understanding these models is crucial for developing strategies to promote calibrated trust.

**Section 5 (Demographics and Background)** collects standard information necessary for describing the sample and controlling for potential confounding variables known to influence energy behaviors and technology adoption.

**Exclusion of Tasks:** Consistent with the instruction to provide a survey question answering format only, behavioral tasks such as the Attari et al. (2010) appliance estimation task or the Marghetis et al. (2019) behavioral choice task have been excluded from this instrument. While these tasks are critical for directly measuring human energy perception biases (H1 context) and performance, their exclusion here maintains the requested format. Future research employing this survey could ideally complement it with such tasks. Similarly, objective AI literacy tasks have been excluded in favor of the MAILS self-report scale, which is explicitly mentioned in the proposal's methodology (Survey Drafts All).

**Manageable Runtime:** The selection of items has aimed for a balance between comprehensive construct coverage and manageable survey length. Utilizing validated short forms where recommended (e.g., MAILS-Short) and selecting representative items from longer scales contributes to a reasonable estimated completion time for an online format.
