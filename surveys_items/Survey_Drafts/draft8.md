## Part F  Beliefs about LLM Accuracy & Utility (custom) <a id="part-f"></a>
*(7-point Likert: Very Inaccurate / Useless 1 – Very Accurate / Useful 7)*  

### Accuracy beliefs  
1. How accurate are LLMs at **estimating appliance electricity use**?  
2. … at **predicting savings from specific actions** (e.g., adding insulation)?  
3. … at **creating personalized energy-conservation plans**?  

### Trustworthiness  
4. I trust the quantitative energy estimates provided by LLMs.  
5. I would double-check LLM energy advice with another source (R).  

### Comparative judgments  
6. Compared with a *Google search*, LLM energy information is: 1 = Much worse – 7 = Much better.  
7. Compared with a *professional home energy audit*, LLM estimates are: 1 = Much worse – 7 = Much better.
