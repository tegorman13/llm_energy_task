## Part 1: Household Energy Perceptions

*(Based on Attari et al., 2010)*

**Instructions:** These questions ask about your estimates of energy use. Your best guess is fine.

**1.1 Appliance Energy Use Estimation**

A standard 100-Watt incandescent light bulb uses **100 units** of energy in one hour. How many units of energy do you think each of the following devices typically consumes if used for **one hour**?

> Enter a number less than 100 if you think the device uses less energy than a 100-Watt bulb. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the device uses more energy. Please enter whole numbers.

| Appliance                             | Your estimate of energy use (units per hour) |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| A refrigerator (running constantly, averaged per hour) | \_\_\_\_\_                                   |
| An electric clothes dryer (while running) | \_\_\_\_\_                                   |
| A laptop computer (while actively used)| \_\_\_\_\_                                   |
| Charging a smartphone                 | \_\_\_\_\_                                   |
| A large screen LED TV (while on)      | \_\_\_\_\_                                   |

**1.2 Energy Savings Estimation**

Turning off a 100-Watt incandescent light bulb for one hour SAVES **100 units** of energy. How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save **per year** (unless otherwise specified)?

> Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy *annually* than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for *one hour*. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy *annually*. Remember to enter the amount of energy **SAVED**.

| Change                                                                                    | Your estimate of energy SAVED (units per year) |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Replacing five 100-watt incandescent bulbs with equally bright LED bulbs (used 3 hours/day) | \_\_\_\_\_                                     |
| Setting your thermostat 2°F lower in winter (all day)                                     | \_\_\_\_\_                                     |
| Unplugging phone chargers when not in use                                                 | \_\_\_\_\_                                     |
| Line drying clothes instead of using an electric dryer (for half the year)                | \_\_\_\_\_                                     |

## Justification Report for Final Survey Draft

This final survey draft integrates the most pertinent measures from the corpus and previous drafts to comprehensively address the research proposal's objectives within a feasible timeframe (estimated 20-25 minutes).

**Rationale for Structure and Flow:**

1.  **Consent & Intro:** Standard ethical start.
2.  **Energy Perceptions (Part 1 - Attari et al.):** Placed early to capture baseline *human* energy misperceptions *before* extensive priming with AI concepts. This is crucial for testing H1 (comparing human biases to perceived LLM accuracy). Using the established relative estimation format provides a direct link to prior literature.
3.  **AI/LLM Familiarity (Part 2):** Basic questions establish prior experience, serving as important control variables.
4.  **LLM Beliefs (Part 3 - Custom):** This core section directly measures the dependent variables for RQ1 and H1 (perceived accuracy, utility) and a key predictor for RQ3 (task-specific trust) regarding LLMs *for energy tasks*. Items are designed to probe accuracy for different task types (factual, estimation, planning) and specific biases (low vs. high impact actions).
5.  **LLM Usage (Part 4 - Custom):** Measures the key outcome variables (willingness/intention, past frequency) for RQ3 and H4, specifically focused on the energy domain. Placed after specific beliefs to assess potential influence.
6.  **General AI Trust (Part 5 - TPA):** Measures general dispositional trust/distrust using the standard TPA scale (Jian et al., 2000). Placed after LLM-specific beliefs to allow testing mediation/moderation effects (RQ4, H4). The full TPA is used for comprehensive coverage of trust/distrust facets.
7.  **Energy Literacy (Part 6 - ELQ Adaptation):** Measures the multidimensional construct (Cognitive, Affective, Behavioral) central to RQ2 and H2b. The cognitive section uses selected, validated multiple-choice items for objective knowledge. Affective and Behavioral sections use selected Likert items. Placed later as it's a distinct individual difference measure.
8.  **AI Literacy (Part 7 - MAILS-Short):** Uses the validated short form to measure self-perceived AI literacy facets relevant to RQ2 and H2c. Placed after energy literacy.
9.  **Objective Numeracy (Part 8 - BNT/CRT):** Measures objective quantitative reasoning skills relevant to RQ2 and H2a. Placed later in the survey as it requires more cognitive effort. Using a mix of BNT/CRT items provides robust assessment.
10. **Demographics (Part 9):** Standard placement at the end.
11. **Conclusion/Debriefing (Part 10):** Standard closing.

**Rationale for Instrument/Item Selection:**

*   **Perceived LLM Accuracy/Utility/Trust (Part 3):** Custom items are essential as no standard scales exist for this specific application domain. Items were carefully crafted based on proposal RQs, H1 (bias testing), and previous drafts, ensuring coverage of estimation vs. planning accuracy/utility/trust.
*   **Energy Perceptions (Part 1):** Using the Attari et al. (2010) relative estimation format provides a validated method to capture baseline human energy misperceptions, directly informing H1.
*   **Numeracy (Part 8):** Uses standard, objective BNT/CRT items frequently paired with energy perception research (Marghetis et al., 2019). The 4-item selection balances rigor and brevity.
*   **Energy Literacy (Part 6):** Uses selected items from the well-established ELQ framework (DeWaters & Powers, 2011) to capture the required multidimensionality (Cognitive, Affective, Behavioral) efficiently. The 6 MC cognitive items cover core concepts. The 4 Affective and 4 Behavioral items capture key attitudes and self-reported actions.
*   **AI Literacy (Part 7):** Uses the validated MAILS-Short (Koch et al., 2024), directly aligning with the proposal and offering a concise, multidimensional self-report measure.
*   **General AI Trust (Part 5):** Uses the full TPA (Jian et al., 2000), a standard instrument in HRI/automation trust, providing comprehensive data on trust/distrust facets needed for RQ4/H4. Although the Shang scale measures cognitive/affective trust explicitly, the TPA is more standard for general trust/distrust and using both would significantly increase length. TPA's factors implicitly cover cognitive aspects (competence, reliability) and some affective elements (wary, suspicious).
*   **LLM Usage (Part 4):** Custom items directly measure the specific outcome variables (willingness, frequency) for energy tasks needed for RQ3/H4.

**Addressing RQs and Hypotheses:**

*   **RQ1/H1:** Addressed by Part 3 (LLM Beliefs) and comparison with Part 1 (Human Perceptions).
*   **RQ2/H2a, H2b, H2c:** Addressed by correlating Part 8 (Numeracy), Part 6 (Energy Literacy), and Part 7 (AI Literacy) with Part 3 (LLM Beliefs).
*   **RQ3/H3:** Addressed by analyzing the relationship between Part 3 (LLM Beliefs/Trust) and Part 4 (LLM Usage).
*   **RQ4/H4:** Addressed by incorporating Part 5 (General AI Trust) into the analysis of the relationship identified for RQ3.

**Feasibility:** The survey contains approximately 88 scored items (excluding intro/demo). With an estimated 15-20 seconds per item, the total time is around 22-29 minutes, fitting the target range. The mix of item types (MC, Likert, slider, open-numeric) adds variety. Validated short forms are used where possible to balance rigor and brevity. This final draft provides a comprehensive yet feasible instrument to address the study's goals.
