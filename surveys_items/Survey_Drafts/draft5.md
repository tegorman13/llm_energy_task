## Justification Report

This survey instrument is designed to address the research questions and hypotheses outlined in the proposal.

**Addressing RQ1 & H1 (Lay Beliefs about LLMs for Energy Tasks):**

*   **Section 2 (Perceptions of LLMs for Energy Tasks):** This section uses custom-designed Likert scale items to directly measure lay beliefs about the **Accuracy** (Items 1.1-1.6), **Utility** (Items 2.1-2.5), and **Task-Specific Trust** (Items 3.1-3.5) of current LLMs for specific household energy management functions.
*   **Accuracy items (1.3 vs. 1.4)** are structured to probe potential biases mirroring human misperceptions (Attari et al., 2010), allowing a test of **H1**. For example, comparing perceived accuracy for high-impact efficiency actions (1.3) vs. low-impact curtailment actions (1.4).
*   The distinction between items focusing on **factual information** (e.g., 1.1, 3.1) versus **personalized planning/estimation** (e.g., 1.6, 2.4, 3.5) directly addresses the latter part of **RQ1**.

**Addressing RQ2 & H2a, H2b, H2c (Role of Individual Differences):**

*   **Section 8 (Objective Numeracy):** Measures objective numeracy using validated BNT/CRT items (Marghetis et al., 2019). These scores will be correlated with the custom perception items from Section 2 to test **H2a**.
*   **Section 5 (Energy Literacy - Affective & Behavioral) & Section 7 (Energy Literacy - Cognitive):** The ELQ (DeWaters & Powers, 2011) provides multidimensional measures. The objective cognitive score from Section 7 will be used to test **H2b** by examining its correlation with skepticism/accuracy perceptions in Section 2. Affective/Behavioral scores serve as covariates or further exploratory variables.
*   **Section 6 (AI Literacy - Self-Report):** The MAILS-Short (Koch et al., 2024) measures perceived AI literacy facets. Scores on facets related to understanding limitations and critical evaluation will be correlated with the custom perception items (Section 2) to test **H2c**.

**Addressing RQ3 & H3 (Perceptions, Trust -> Intentions/Usage):**

*   **Section 3 (LLM Usage Intentions and Frequency):** Custom items measure **Willingness to Use/Reliance Intentions** (Items 4.1-4.5) and **Past Usage Frequency** (Item 5.1) specifically for energy tasks.
*   These outcome variables (Section 3) will be regressed on the predictor variables from Section 2 (Perceived Accuracy, Perceived Utility, Task-Specific Trust) to test **H3**.

**Addressing RQ4 & H4 (Role of General AI Trust):**

*   **Section 4 (General Trust and Distrust in AI):** Measures general AI trust/distrust using two validated scales:
    *   **TPA (Jian et al., 2000):** A standard measure capturing core trust/distrust facets (competence, integrity, etc.).
    *   **Shang & Hsieh (2025) Semantic Differential:** Explicitly measures cognitive and affective dimensions of trust.
*   These general trust scores will be incorporated into mediation/moderation models. **H4** (mediation) will be tested by examining if the relationship between specific beliefs (Section 2) and willingness/frequency (Section 3) is significantly carried through general trust scores (Section 4). Moderation analyses can also explore if general trust alters the strength of the belief-intention link.

**Overall Structure & Runtime:**

The survey flows logically from specific perceptions of LLMs for energy tasks, to usage intentions/frequency, then to broader constructs like general AI trust and individual literacies, before concluding with objective tests and demographics. This structure aims to keep related concepts together and places more demanding objective tests later. The selection prioritizes validated scales where available (ELQ, MAILS-Short, TPA, Shang et al., BNT/CRT) and uses custom items for the core novel constructs (LLM energy perceptions/trust/use). While the ELQ Cognitive section (33 items) and Shang scale (27 items) are relatively long, the overall number of items (~148) should be manageable within the 20-25 minute target, assuming efficient electronic administration. If piloting indicates excessive length, shortening the ELQ Cognitive or Shang scales could be considered.
