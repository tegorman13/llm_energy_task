### Justification Report

**Introduction:**

This survey instrument has been constructed to empirically investigate lay perceptions regarding the accuracy and utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for household energy management tasks. Drawing upon theoretical constructs from cognitive psychology, particularly those related to judgment and decision-making under uncertainty, energy decision-making, various forms of literacy (numeracy, energy, AI), and human-AI trust calibration, the survey employs a combination of adapted validated measures and custom items. The goal is to collect quantitative data through self-report and objective knowledge questions to test the study's research questions and hypotheses within a manageable runtime.

**Alignment with Research Questions and Hypotheses:**

The survey is structured to directly address the proposed research questions and hypotheses as follows:

*   **RQ1: What are lay beliefs about the accuracy and utility of LLMs for household energy management tasks (e.g., estimating appliance energy use, creating conservation plans)?**
    *   Hypothesis H1 posits that users will overestimate LLM accuracy for energy tasks, potentially mirroring known human misperceptions rooted in cognitive heuristics [User Proposal H1]. The **"Lay Beliefs about LLM Accuracy and Utility for Energy Tasks"** section (Section 7) directly probes participants' subjective assessments of LLM capabilities for these specific tasks using Likert scale items. These items are custom-developed to target the domain-specific perceptions (e.g., accuracy of energy estimates, usefulness of conservation plans), which existing general AI trust or perception scales do not cover. By comparing these subjective beliefs to known human biases in energy estimation (documented by Attari et al., 2010), this section is foundational to testing H1 and addressing RQ1. The **"Task-Specific Trust in LLMs for Energy Tasks"** section (Section 8) further refines this by asking about trust specifically for various energy-related activities, providing a more granular measure of perceived utility and reliance in this domain.

*   **RQ2: How do individual differences in numeracy, energy literacy, and AI literacy predict these beliefs about LLM accuracy and utility?**
    *   Hypotheses H2a, H2b, and H2c predict that higher numeracy, energy literacy, and AI literacy, respectively, will correlate with potentially better-calibrated or more critical assessments of LLM performance [User Proposal H2a, H2b, H2c].
        *   **Numeracy:** The **"Individual Differences: Numeracy"** section (Section 3) employs items adapted from established numeracy assessments used in prior energy perception research (Attari et al., 2010; Marghetis et al., 2019). These items measure quantitative reasoning skills hypothesized to influence individuals' ability to evaluate the plausibility of energy-related figures or recommendations provided by an LLM, thus addressing H2a.
        *   **Energy Literacy:** The **"Individual Differences: Multidimensional Energy Literacy"** section (Section 4) captures cognitive knowledge, affective attitudes, and self-reported behaviors related to energy. The cognitive knowledge items (Section 4.1) are adapted from validated energy literacy questionnaires (DeWaters & Powers, 2011/2013) and draw on concepts from Attari et al. (2010) regarding appliance energy use knowledge. Affective attitudes (Section 4.2) and self-reported behaviors (Section 4.3) utilize Likert scales consistent with established measures (DeWaters & Powers, 2011/2013). This multidimensional assessment provides the data necessary to test how different facets of energy literacy relate to perceptions of LLM capabilities in the energy domain, addressing H2b.
        *   **AI Literacy:** The **"Individual Differences: AI Literacy"** section (Section 5) uses custom items designed to represent the key facets of the MAILS Short Form (Koch et al., 2024), an established self-report scale for general AI literacy. By covering areas like understanding, application, critical evaluation, and self-efficacy, this section provides a measure of perceived AI literacy relevant to understanding how individuals appraise AI systems, including LLMs. This assessment allows for testing H2c, examining how self-perceived AI literacy relates to beliefs about LLM performance for energy tasks.

*   **RQ3: Do perceived LLM accuracy and task-specific trust predict users' self-reported willingness and recent frequency of LLM use for energy-related decisions?**
    *   Hypothesis H3 states that perceived accuracy and trust will predict willingness to rely on these tools [User Proposal H3]. The **"LLM Usage Frequency and Willingness for Energy Tasks"** section (Section 10) includes custom items specifically asking about past usage frequency and future willingness to use LLMs *for household energy management tasks*. These items serve as the primary dependent variables for RQ3 and H3, assessed in relation to the measures of perceived accuracy (Section 7) and task-specific trust (Section 8).

*   **RQ4: Does general trust or distrust in AI mediate or moderate the relationship between beliefs about LLM accuracy/utility and willingness to use LLMs for energy-related decisions?**
    *   Hypothesis H4 explores the role of general AI trust [User Proposal H4]. The **"General Trust and Distrust in AI"** section (Section 6) includes custom items based on the facets of the TPA-Revised scale (Lai et al., 2024). This scale measures general dispositional trust and distrust in AI as separate constructs, which is crucial for investigating their potentially distinct roles as mediators or moderators in the relationship between task-specific beliefs (Sections 7, 8) and behavioral intention/usage (Section 10), addressing RQ4 and H4.

**Additional Constructs and Measures:**

*   **Attributional Beliefs:** The **"Attributional Beliefs about LLM Operations"** section (Section 9) includes custom items exploring participants' mental models of how LLMs acquire information, conceptually informed by prior work on AI perception (e.g., Chen et al., 2025). While not tied to a specific primary hypothesis, these exploratory items can provide valuable context for understanding the basis of perceived accuracy and trust, potentially revealing systematic misunderstandings about LLM capabilities and limitations that could influence critical evaluation and reliance.
*   **Demographics:** Standard demographic questions (Section 2) are included to describe the sample and allow for analyses of how these factors might relate to individual differences or perceptions.
*   **Data Quality and Feedback:** The inclusion of a data quality check (Section 11) and an open feedback section (Section 12) are standard practices in online survey methodology to identify potentially invalid responses and gather qualitative insights for refining future research.

**Construct Validity and Measurement Approach:**

The survey design prioritizes quantitative measures through Likert scales, multiple-choice questions, and open-ended numeric responses (for numeracy). While some measures are custom-written for domain specificity (Sections 7, 8, 9, 10), their construction is informed by the types of questions and constructs measured in validated scales (e.g., adapting trust item concepts to the energy domain). Where possible, measures are based on or adapted from validated instruments (Numeracy, Energy Literacy Knowledge/Attitudes/Behaviors, AI Literacy Facets, General Trust/Distrust Facets).

The use of self-report measures, while efficient for large samples in a survey format, is acknowledged to have limitations, such as social desirability bias or inaccuracies in recall. However, for assessing subjective beliefs (perceived accuracy, utility, trust), self-report is the most direct method. For behavioral frequency and intention, while experimental tasks offer higher ecological validity for actual behavior, self-report is the feasible approach within this survey design.

The selection of specific items and the development of custom questions have been guided by the need to precisely measure the variables outlined in the proposal and ensure they map onto the theoretical constructs and hypothesized relationships. For instance, capturing perceived accuracy for *specific* energy tasks rather than just general AI accuracy allows for a direct test of whether LLM perceptions mirror documented biases in *human* energy estimation (H1). Similarly, tailoring trust and usage questions to the energy domain ensures direct relevance to the core research questions.

Future validation steps for the custom measures (e.g., through pilot testing with cognitive interviews or psychometric evaluation in a dedicated study) would enhance the rigor of the instrument. However, for this initial study utilizing a survey-only design, the presented instrument provides a comprehensive and logically ordered approach to collect the necessary data to test the proposed hypotheses and address the research questions.

**Conclusion:**

The designed survey instrument aligns well with the study proposal's objectives. By incorporating measures of key individual differences and perceptions of LLMs specifically within the household energy management context, the survey is well-suited to investigate how cognitive factors and AI-related beliefs shape the perceived utility and potential adoption of LLMs for these tasks. The combination of adapted established measures and targeted custom items provides a robust foundation for empirically testing the proposed hypotheses regarding the role of numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy, and trust in shaping lay perceptions of LLMs in this novel domain.

The study addresses a critical intersection of cognitive biases in energy perception and the emerging role of AI in providing information and guidance. Research consistently demonstrates that individuals exhibit systematic misperceptions regarding household energy consumption and the effectiveness of various conservation actions, often relying on simplifying heuristics that lead to significant deviations from actual energy data. These biases include overestimating the impact of low-consumption activities (like turning off lights) and underestimating high-consumption activities (like heating/cooling or driving). Your proposal posits that LLMs, as potential information providers, may interact with these pre-existing cognitive structures. Understanding user perceptions of LLM capabilities in this domain is crucial for ensuring calibrated trust—where trust aligns with actual reliability—and mitigating potential harms from misapplying or over-relying on potentially inaccurate AI outputs.

Individual differences in cognitive abilities (numeracy), domain-specific knowledge (energy literacy), and technology understanding (AI literacy) are hypothesized to influence how users evaluate and trust information from LLMs. Numeracy is linked to better comprehension of quantitative data. Energy literacy, encompassing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, provides the domain expertise necessary for critically evaluating energy-related information. AI literacy, particularly understanding AI limitations and capabilities, is posited to influence how users assess the trustworthiness and applicability of AI-generated content. Finally, perceptions of LLM accuracy and trustworthiness are theorized to predict the willingness to adopt and use these tools for energy decisions, consistent with technology acceptance models.

The survey instrument below is constructed by selecting or adapting items from the provided sources to operationalize these constructs. Where no validated scale exists for a specific construct (e.g., perceived LLM accuracy for energy tasks), custom items are proposed, informed by the content and measurement approaches used in related research.

## 10. Willingness to Use LLMs for Energy Tasks

*   **Source:** Custom self-report items based on behavioral intention measures, potentially drawing from UTAUT framework wording.
*   **Type:** 7-point Likert scale (1=Extremely Unlikely, 7=Extremely Likely or 1=Strongly Disagree, 7=Strongly Agree).
*   **Rationale:** Measures future behavioral intention regarding LLM use for energy decisions (RQ3, H3, H4).

Please indicate how likely you would be to use a state-of-the-art AI chatbot (like ChatGPT or Gemini) for the following household energy management tasks in the future:

| Task                                                                           | Extremely Unlikely | Very Unlikely | Unlikely | Neutral | Likely | Very Likely | Extremely Likely |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------ | :------- | :------ | :----- | :---------- | :--------------- |
| 1. Get information about the energy consumption of a specific appliance.       | 1                  | 2             | 3        | 4       | 5      | 6           | 7                |
| 2. Estimate how much energy you could save by taking a specific action.        | 1                  | 2             | 3        | 4       | 5      | 6           | 7                |
| 3. Get advice on simple ways to reduce your household energy bill.             | 1                  | 2             | 3        | 4       | 5      | 6           | 7                |
| 4. Create a personalized energy-saving plan for your home.                     | 1                  | 2             | 3        | 4       | 5      | 6           | 7                |
| 5. Understand information on your electricity or utility bill.                 | 1                  | 2             | 3        | 4       | 5      | 6           | 7                |

## 11. Frequency of Past LLM Use for Energy Tasks

*   **Source:** Custom self-report items based on behavioral frequency measures, potentially drawing from usage frequency scales (e.g., Kim et al., 2024; Ravselj et al., 2024).
*   **Type:** Categorical or Likert scale (e.g., Never to Very Often).
*   **Rationale:** Measures self-reported past behavior regarding LLM use for energy decisions (RQ3, H4).

1.  In the past [Specify time frame, e.g., 3 months], how often have you used any AI chatbot (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) for tasks related to understanding or reducing your household energy consumption (e.g., asking about appliance use, getting saving tips, trying to understand your bill)?
    *   ( ) Never
    *   ( ) Rarely (once or twice)
    *   ( ) Sometimes (about once a month)
    *   ( ) Often (multiple times a month)
    *   ( ) Very Often (multiple times a week)

This survey instrument provides a foundation for measuring the constructs central to your proposal, combining validated scales where available with custom items designed to capture the specific nature of LLM perceptions and use within the household energy domain. The ordering moves from general individual differences to specific LLM perceptions and usage, facilitating a logical flow for participants. The estimated runtime appears manageable for an online format. Careful pilot testing of the custom items is recommended to ensure clarity, validity, and reliability within the target population.

## Brief Justification Report

**Coverage of Research Questions**

* **RQ1 (Prevailing lay beliefs)** – Section A captures perceived *accuracy*, *utility*, and *task-specific trust* for both **estimation** and **planning** subtasks, mirroring the proposal’s dual focus. Items come directly from the most detailed drafts .

* **RQ2 (Individual-difference predictors)** – Sections D (MAILS), E (ELQ), and F (Numeracy) provide validated, multi-dimensional measures linked to cognitive psychology models of decision-making; their short-forms retain psychometric integrity while keeping run-time low.&#x20;

* **RQ3 (Accuracy + trust → use)** – Section B’s intention & behaviour items align with technology-acceptance frameworks and can be regressed on A-block scores to test joint influence.

* **RQ4 (General AI trust as mediator/moderator)** – Section C (TPA-R) supplies separate **trust** and **distrust** latent factors, enabling moderated-mediation analyses, as recommended in recent psychometric work.&#x20;

**Alignment with Hypotheses**

* **H1 (overall optimism & bias)** – Mean accuracy scores from A1 plus relative ratings on high- vs low-impact actions will reveal bias patterns.
* **H2a–c (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy)** – Simple correlations or SEM can test calibration vs scepticism predictions using Sections D–F.
* **H3 (beliefs → willingness)** – Path analysis from A-block through B-block confirms or disconfirms the directional expectation.
* **H4 (general trust mediates)** – Indirect‐effect tests with Section C scores quantify this pathway.

**Run-Time Estimate**

| Block        | Items | Time (s)                                |
| ------------ | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| Demo + Prior | 10    | 60                                      |
| Section A    | 11    | 90                                      |
| Section B    | 4     | 30                                      |
| Section C    | 8     | 50                                      |
| Section D    | 10    | 70                                      |
| Section E    | 16    | 120                                     |
| Section F    | 4     | 60                                      |
| **Total**    | 63    | **≈ 8 min median, 15 min conservative** |

**Why These Particular Items?**

* They are **validated short forms** (MAILS-Short, TPA-R, BNT-4, ELQ key items) or **domain-specific customs** mapped precisely to the proposal’s constructs.
* Redundancies across drafts were removed, but distinctive advantages (e.g., comparative utility item, hesitation reverse item) were retained to improve scale reliability (α > .80 expected) without inflating length.
* The ordering moves from less to more cognitively demanding material, limiting fatigue effects, and separates belief measures from intention measures to reduce consistency bias.

This consolidated instrument therefore provides the necessary data breadth with minimal respondent burden, fully supporting the planned hypothesis tests while remaining practical for large-sample online deployment.

## Justification Report

The survey instrument delineated above is meticulously constructed to operationalize the constructs central to your proposal, aiming to investigate the complex interplay between individual cognitive characteristics, established energy perception biases, AI literacy, trust dynamics, and the perceived capabilities and adoption potential of LLMs for household energy management. Drawing upon principles from cognitive psychology, decision-making under uncertainty, and human-AI interaction literature, the design aligns directly with the proposed research questions and hypotheses (RQ1-RQ4, H1-H4).

**Alignment with Research Questions and Hypotheses:**

The instrument is structured to address each research question and test the associated hypotheses:

*   **RQ1: Lay beliefs about LLM accuracy and utility for energy tasks; differentiation of trust for specific tasks.** This question is primarily addressed by **Section 3.3 (Perceived LLM Accuracy & Utility)** and **Section 3.4 (Task-Specific Trust in LLMs for Energy Tasks)**.
    *   **H1** posits that lay perceptions of LLM accuracy will mirror known human biases in energy estimation (e.g., overestimating low-impact, underestimating high-impact activities) (Attari et al., 2010; Marghetis et al., 2019). While this survey version *excludes* the behavioral estimation task that directly measures human bias, the custom items in Section 3.3 are *designed* to probe perceptions of LLM accuracy for tasks (e.g., appliance estimation, savings estimation) where these biases are known to occur in human judgment. Future analysis will compare aggregated perceived LLM accuracy patterns to documented human biases to test this hypothesis, as recommended in the survey design notes (Survey Drafts All). The inclusion of custom items is necessitated by the absence of pre-established scales specifically measuring perceived LLM capability in the energy domain (Survey Eval; Survey Sums All; Gemini App responses).
    *   Section 3.3 also includes items on perceived *utility* for various energy tasks (e.g., understanding bills, creating plans), directly addressing the "utility" component of RQ1.
    *   Section 3.4, with its custom items on task-specific trust, directly probes whether users differentiate their trust in LLMs for distinct energy functions like estimation versus planning, as specified in RQ1 (Survey Drafts All; Gemini App responses).

*   **RQ2: Influence of individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy) on lay beliefs about LLM capabilities.** This question is addressed by the measures in **Section 2 (Individual Differences)** as predictors of responses in Section 3.3 and 3.4.
    *   **H2a** predicts that higher objective numeracy is associated with better-calibrated beliefs about LLM quantitative capabilities. **Section 2.1 (Numeracy)** employs basic quantitative reasoning items adapted from prior energy perception research (Attari et al., 2010; Marghetis et al., 2019). While not the full Berlin Numeracy Test, these items provide a measure of quantitative skill relevant to evaluating numerical energy information (Survey Drafts All).
    *   **H2b** suggests that higher energy literacy, particularly cognitive knowledge, leads to more critical evaluation of LLM outputs. **Section 2.2 (Energy Literacy: Cognitive Knowledge)** uses multiple-choice items adapted from the ELQ (DeWaters & Powers, 2011/2013; Canfield et al., 2017) covering fundamental household energy concepts. This provides an objective measure of domain knowledge, hypothesized to enable individuals to identify potentially implausible LLM suggestions (Proposal discussion; Survey Drafts All). The affective (Section 2.3) and behavioral (Section 2.4) subscales of energy literacy are included as important multidimensional components that may also relate to engagement with energy information, consistent with the ELQ's structure (DeWaters & Powers, 2011/2013; Survey Drafts All).
    *   **H2c** links higher AI literacy, especially critical evaluation facets, to more nuanced beliefs about LLM capabilities. **Section 2.5 (AI Literacy)** utilizes items from the MAILS-Short (Koch et al., 2024), a validated self-report scale covering multiple AI literacy dimensions, including understanding, critical evaluation, and self-efficacy (MAILS reference from Survey Eval; Survey Drafts All). This measure assesses perceived AI literacy hypothesized to mitigate uncritical acceptance of AI outputs (Proposal discussion; Survey Drafts All).

*   **RQ3: Influence of perceived LLM accuracy and task-specific trust on willingness and frequency of LLM use for energy tasks.** This is addressed by responses in **Section 3.3, 3.4, and Section 4 (LLM Usage for Energy Tasks)**.
    *   **H3** posits that favorable beliefs regarding accuracy and trustworthiness are positively associated with willingness to use LLMs for energy decisions. Responses to Section 3.3 and 3.4 are intended to predict responses in **Section 4.1 (Willingness to Use)** and **Section 4.2 (Past Frequency of Use)**. Custom items are used in Section 4 because general AI usage scales lack the necessary specificity to energy tasks (Gemini App responses; Survey Drafts All). This aligns with technology acceptance models where perceived usefulness and ease of use (proxied here by accuracy/utility and trust) drive behavioral intentions (Chen & Zhao, 2025 reference in Proposal).

*   **RQ4: Role of general trust/distrust in AI as mediator or moderator.** This is addressed by measures in **Section 3.1 (General Trust and Distrust in AI)** in relation to the pathways examined in RQ3.
    *   **H4** hypothesizes that general trust in AI mediates the positive relationship between favorable specific beliefs/task-specific trust and usage willingness/frequency. **Section 3.1** includes items adapted from the TPA-Revised (Lai et al., 2024), capturing general trust and distrust as distinct constructs (Survey Eval; Survey Drafts All). Measuring both trust and distrust separately is crucial for investigating potentially different mediating or moderating effects (Lai et al., 2024; Survey Drafts All). This allows for examining whether believing an LLM is effective for energy tasks influences broader AI trust, which in turn affects usage intentions, or whether general trust/distrust simply shapes how task-specific beliefs translate into behavior.

**Additional Considerations:**

**Section 3.2 (Attributional Beliefs about LLMs)** includes custom items probing potential user mental models of LLM operation (e.g., access to data, potential for error, capacity for personalization). While not tied to a specific hypothesis in the provided proposal summary, these items provide valuable explanatory data for *why* users hold certain beliefs about accuracy and utility, connecting to the literature on user mental models of AI (Buçinca et al., 2021 reference in Proposal). Understanding these models is crucial for developing strategies to promote calibrated trust.

**Section 5 (Demographics and Background)** collects standard information necessary for describing the sample and controlling for potential confounding variables known to influence energy behaviors and technology adoption.

**Exclusion of Tasks:** Consistent with the instruction to provide a survey question answering format only, behavioral tasks such as the Attari et al. (2010) appliance estimation task or the Marghetis et al. (2019) behavioral choice task have been excluded from this instrument. While these tasks are critical for directly measuring human energy perception biases (H1 context) and performance, their exclusion here maintains the requested format. Future research employing this survey could ideally complement it with such tasks. Similarly, objective AI literacy tasks have been excluded in favor of the MAILS self-report scale, which is explicitly mentioned in the proposal's methodology (Survey Drafts All).

**Manageable Runtime:** The selection of items has aimed for a balance between comprehensive construct coverage and manageable survey length. Utilizing validated short forms where recommended (e.g., MAILS-Short) and selecting representative items from longer scales contributes to a reasonable estimated completion time for an online format.

## Justification Report

This survey instrument is meticulously constructed to operationalize the theoretical constructs central to the proposed study, drawing directly from the measurement approaches and validated scales discussed in the provided sources. The selection and ordering of items are designed to align with the study's research questions (RQs) and hypotheses (Hs) while maintaining a manageable cognitive load and runtime for participants in a survey-only format.

**Alignment with Research Questions (RQs):**

*   **RQ1: Prevailing lay beliefs concerning LLM accuracy and utility for energy tasks (estimation & planning) and differentiated trust.** This RQ is directly addressed by **Section 6 (Perceptions of LLM Accuracy and Utility)** and **Section 7 (Task-Specific Trust in LLMs)**.
    *   Section 6 contains custom-developed items using a 7-point Likert scale to capture subjective beliefs about the perceived accuracy and utility of LLMs for specific energy management functions, such as estimating appliance use, predicting savings from actions, understanding bills, and generating plans. The inclusion of perceived accuracy for both estimation and planning tasks allows for a direct examination of beliefs across these distinct functions, as required by RQ1.
    *   Section 7 employs custom items to assess task-specific trust, probing confidence and reliance specifically within the energy domain (e.g., trusting numerical estimates, technical advice, or personalized plans). By differentiating trust items across estimation, planning, and decision-support contexts, this section directly investigates whether lay trust is nuanced based on the specific energy task, fulfilling a key component of RQ1.

*   **RQ2: Predictive role of individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy) on lay beliefs.** This RQ examines how cognitive capacities and domain-specific knowledge influence perceptions of LLM capabilities.
    *   **Section 1 (Numeracy)** includes items adapted from the Berlin Numeracy Test, a standard instrument for assessing quantitative reasoning skills. Higher numeracy is hypothesized (H2a) to predict better-calibrated assessments of quantitative LLM outputs, particularly relevant for tasks involving energy units and savings calculations.
    *   **Section 2 (Energy Literacy: Cognitive Knowledge)** features multiple-choice questions adapted from the DeWaters & Powers ELQ, covering fundamental household energy concepts. This provides an objective measure of domain-specific knowledge. Higher cognitive energy literacy (H2b) is expected to correlate with more critical evaluation of LLM outputs, as domain expertise can inform the plausibility assessment of AI-generated information.
    *   **Section 3 (Energy Literacy: Affective and Behavioral)** complements the cognitive measure with items on environmental attitudes and self-reported conservation behaviors, drawing from ELQ and other established scales. While H2b primarily focuses on cognitive literacy for critical evaluation, the inclusion of affective and behavioral dimensions provides a more comprehensive understanding of energy literacy, consistent with its multidimensional conceptualization. These dimensions may also correlate with engagement with energy management topics and potentially beliefs about tools like LLMs.
    *   **Section 4 (AI Literacy: Self-Report)** utilizes the MAILS-Short, a validated self-report scale capturing various facets of AI literacy, including understanding, application, critical evaluation, and ethics. Higher scores on relevant MAILS dimensions (e.g., 'Evaluate AI', 'Understand AI') are hypothesized (H2c) to predict more cautious or nuanced beliefs about LLM capabilities, particularly awareness of limitations and potential inaccuracies.
    *   Statistical analysis will correlate scores from Sections 1, 2, 3 (subscales), and 4 with the belief scores from Section 6 to directly address RQ2.

*   **RQ3: Joint influence of perceived LLM accuracy and task-specific trust on willingness/frequency of use.** This RQ investigates the link between specific beliefs about LLM performance and intended/past behavior.
    *   **Section 6 (Perceived LLM Accuracy and Utility)** and **Section 7 (Task-Specific Trust in LLMs)** provide the predictor variables (perceived accuracy, perceived utility, task-specific trust).
    *   **Section 8 (LLM Usage Intentions and Frequency)** contains custom items assessing both self-reported past frequency of using LLMs for energy tasks and future willingness/intention to use them for these purposes. These items serve as the primary outcome variables for RQ3.
    *   Analysis will examine how perceived accuracy, utility, and task-specific trust (from Sections 6 and 7) collectively predict reported frequency and willingness to use LLMs for energy tasks (from Section 8), directly testing H3.

*   **RQ4: Mediation/Moderation role of general AI trust/distrust.** This RQ explores whether broader trust dispositions towards AI influence the relationship between task-specific beliefs and usage.
    *   **Section 5 (General Trust and Distrust in AI)** includes items adapted from the TPA-Revised, measuring general trust and distrust as separate constructs. This separation is crucial for exploring potentially distinct roles in the proposed mediation or moderation model.
    *   Scores from Section 5 will be incorporated into statistical models (e.g., mediation, moderation analyses) to examine how general trust and/or distrust influence the pathway from task-specific beliefs/trust (Sections 6, 7) to usage intentions/frequency (Section 8), addressing RQ4 and testing H4.

**Informing Hypotheses (Hs):**

*   **H1: Laypeople perceive LLMs as relatively accurate, but perceptions reflect human biases.** The perceived accuracy items in **Section 6** (specifically Q1-Q4) directly measure the first part of this hypothesis. High mean scores would support the idea of perceived relative accuracy. While the human behavioral estimation task (Attari et al., 2010) is excluded here, the design of Section 6 items, prompting perceptions for tasks known to be subject to human bias (e.g., appliance estimation, low vs. high impact savings), allows for comparing the pattern of *perceived* LLM accuracy to known patterns of *human* bias as documented by Attari et al. (2010) and Marghetis et al. (2019). For instance, if participants perceive LLMs as less accurate for estimating savings from low-impact actions compared to high-impact ones (mirroring the human tendency to overestimate the impact of curtailment), this would provide evidence for the latter part of H1.

*   **H2a: Higher numeracy correlates with better-calibrated assessment.** Numeracy scores from **Section 1** will be correlated with perceived accuracy ratings in **Section 6**, particularly for items involving quantitative estimation (Q1-Q3). Higher numeracy is expected to correlate with less extreme or potentially more nuanced accuracy perceptions.

*   **H2b: Higher energy literacy correlates with more critical/skeptical evaluation.** Cognitive energy literacy scores from **Section 2** are hypothesized to correlate negatively with perceived accuracy and task-specific trust scores in **Sections 6 and 7**. Affective and behavioral scores from **Section 3** may also show relationships, potentially influencing engagement or general disposition towards energy tools.

*   **H2c: Higher AI literacy correlates with more cautious/nuanced beliefs.** Scores from **Section 4 (MAILS-Short)**, particularly facets related to critical evaluation and understanding limitations, are expected to correlate negatively with perceived accuracy and trust in **Sections 6 and 7**, indicating a more cautious or skeptical appraisal.

*   **H3: Favorable beliefs (accuracy, trust) predict willingness to use.** Perceived accuracy, utility (Section 6), and task-specific trust (Section 7) scores are hypothesized to positively predict self-reported past frequency and future willingness to use LLMs for energy tasks (Section 8).

*   **H4: General trust mediates or moderates the relationship between specific beliefs and willingness/frequency.** General trust and distrust scores from **Section 5** will be analyzed as mediators or moderators in the relationship between specific beliefs/trust (Sections 6, 7) and usage (Section 8), as proposed by H4.
