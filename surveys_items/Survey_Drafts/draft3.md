**Instructions:** The following questions ask about your perceptions of energy use for various household appliances. Your best estimates are fine.

**1.1 Appliance Energy Use Estimation**

A standard 100-Watt incandescent light bulb uses **100 units** of energy in one hour. How many units of energy do you think each of the following devices typically consumes if used for **one hour**?

> Enter a number less than 100 if you think the device uses less energy than a 100-Watt bulb. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the device uses more energy. Please enter whole numbers.

| Appliance                             | Your estimate of energy use (units per hour) |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| A compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb (as bright as 100W incandescent) | \_\_\_\_\_                                   |
| A laptop computer                     | \_\_\_\_\_                                   |

| A microwave oven                      | \_\_\_\_\_                                   |
| Charging a smartphone                 | \_\_\_\_\_                                   |

**1.2 Energy Savings Estimation**

Turning off a 100-Watt incandescent light bulb for one hour SAVES **100 units** of energy. How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

> Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy. Please enter whole numbers. Remember to enter the amount of energy **SAVED**.

| Change                                                                                    | Your estimate of energy SAVED (units) |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Replacing one 100-watt incandescent bulb with an equally bright compact fluorescent bulb that is used for one hour | \_\_\_\_\_                            |
| Drying clothes on a clothes line (not using the dryer) for one load of laundry            | \_\_\_\_\_                            |
| In the winter: turning down the thermostat on your heater (making your home cooler) by 5° F for one hour | \_\_\_\_\_                            |

**2.2** Out of 1,000 people in a small town 500 are members of a choir. Out of these 500 members in the choir 100 are men. Out of the 500 inhabitants that are not in the choir 300 are men. What is the probability that a randomly drawn man is a member of the choir? (please indicate the probability in percent).
\_\_\_\_ %

**2.3** Imagine we are throwing a loaded die (6 sides). The probability that the die shows a 6 is twice as high as the probability of each of the other numbers. On average, out of these 70 throws, how many times would the die show the number 6?
\_\_\_\_ out of 70 throws.

**2.4** In a forest 20% of mushrooms are red, 50% brown and 30% white. A red mushroom is poisonous with a probability of 20%. A mushroom that is not red is poisonous with a probability of 5%. What is the probability that a poisonous mushroom in the forest is red?

## Justification Report for Survey Instrument

This survey instrument is designed to comprehensively address the research questions and hypotheses outlined in the proposal by measuring lay beliefs about LLM accuracy/utility for energy tasks and their relationship with individual differences and behavioral intentions.

**Addressing Research Questions and Hypotheses:**

1.  **RQ1 & H1 (LLM Beliefs & Biases):**
    *   **Part 5 (Beliefs about LLMs for Energy Tasks):** Uses custom Likert-scale items to directly assess perceived accuracy and utility of LLMs for (a) energy estimation and (b) personalized planning, fulfilling RQ1's core requirement. Items 5.1.1-5.1.4 probe estimation accuracy for different appliances/actions, allowing comparison to known human biases (H1). Item 5.1.3 (savings from lights) vs. 5.1.4 (savings from windows) specifically tests the hypothesized bias related to curtailment vs. efficiency. Item 5.1.5 assesses planning accuracy. Items 5.2.1-5.2.3 assess perceived utility for understanding, tips, and planning. Items 5.3.1-5.3.2 assess task-specific trust for estimation vs. planning.
    *   **Part 1 (Energy Use Perceptions):** Includes selected Attari et al. (2010) estimation tasks. This establishes a baseline measure of participants' *own* energy misperceptions, providing crucial context for H1 (comparing perceived LLM accuracy to human bias patterns).

2.  **RQ2 & H2a, H2b, H2c (Predictors: Numeracy, Energy Literacy, AI Literacy):**
    *   **Part 2 (Numeracy):** Employs the Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT), a validated measure of objective numeracy, to directly test H2a regarding calibrated assessment of LLM quantitative capabilities.
    *   **Part 3 (Energy Literacy):** Uses selected items from the DeWaters & Powers (2011) ELQ framework to capture cognitive knowledge (3.1), affective attitudes (3.2), and behavioral components (3.3), fulfilling the multidimensional requirement for RQ2. The cognitive items (3.1) specifically address the knowledge needed for critical evaluation relevant to H2b.
    *   **Part 4 (AI Literacy):** Uses the MAILS-Short scale (Koch et al., 2024), as specified in the proposal, to assess multiple AI literacy facets, including understanding and critical evaluation (items 4.1, 4.5, 4.10), relevant for testing H2c.

3.  **RQ3 & H3 (LLM Use Intentions/Frequency):**
    *   **Part 7 (LLM-Specific Trust & Usage):** Item 7.2.1 (Custom) measures self-reported past frequency of LLM use *specifically for energy tasks*. Item 7.2.2 (Custom) measures future willingness/intention to use LLMs *specifically for energy tasks*. These directly address RQ3.
    *   **Part 5 (Beliefs about LLMs for Energy Tasks):** Provides the predictor variables (perceived accuracy, utility, task-specific trust) needed to test H3's proposed positive association between favorable beliefs and usage intentions.

4.  **RQ4 & H4 (General AI Trust - Mediation/Moderation):**
    *   **Part 6 (General Trust in AI):** Includes the TPA (Jian et al., 2000) (6.1) to measure general trust/distrust dimensions and the Semantic Differential AI-Trust scale (cognitive items) (Shang et al., 2025) (6.2) to capture cognitive trust nuances, as specified in RQ4. These measures provide the necessary data to test H4's mediation/moderation hypotheses regarding the role of general trust attitudes.
    *   **Part 7 (LLM-Specific Trust & Usage):** Includes the TILLMI scale (Duro et al., 2025) (7.1) to assess trust specifically related to LLMs (reliance, closeness), allowing comparison between general AI trust and LLM-specific trust.

**Structure and Flow:**

*   The survey starts with energy perceptions (Part 1) to anchor participants in the domain *before* introducing AI/LLM concepts, minimizing priming effects.
*   Cognitive measures (Numeracy, Energy Knowledge - Part 2 & 3.1) are placed relatively early.
*   Attitudinal/Behavioral Energy Literacy (Part 3.2, 3.3) follows.
*   AI Literacy (Part 4) transitions the focus to AI.
*   LLM-specific beliefs and trust (Part 5) are measured next, forming the core dependent variables related to RQ1.
*   General AI trust (Part 6) and LLM-specific trust/usage (Part 7) follow, allowing for analysis of relationships between specific beliefs, general attitudes, and behavioral outcomes (RQ3, RQ4).
*   Demographics (Part 8) are placed last, as is standard practice.

**Instrument Selection:**

*   Validated, widely used scales are employed where available and appropriate (BNT, ELQ adaptation, MAILS-Short, TPA, Shang SemDiff, TILLMI).
*   Custom items are developed specifically for the constructs unique to this study: perceived LLM accuracy/utility *for energy tasks*, task-specific trust *for energy tasks*, and usage frequency/intention *for energy tasks*. These are necessary as no standard scales exist for this specific intersection.
*   The Attari et al. (2010) estimation task is included as a critical component for establishing baseline human perception biases (H1).

**Sufficiency and Feasibility:**

The selected battery covers all constructs necessary to address the research questions and test the hypotheses. The combination of standard scales and targeted custom items provides both breadth and specificity. The estimated length (~25 minutes) is feasible for online administration without excessive participant burden. Piloting the custom items is recommended to ensure clarity and psychometric quality.


Overall, this survey instrument is well-constructed to meet the objectives of the research proposal by integrating established measures with necessary custom questions in a logical flow.
