# Justification Report

## Alignment with Research Questions and Hypotheses

**RQ1: Prevailing lay beliefs about LLM accuracy and utility for energy estimation and planning.**

- *Sections 6 \& 7* directly measure perceived accuracy, utility, and trust in LLMs for both factual energy estimation and personalized planning, using custom items that mirror the structure of Attari et al. (2010) and the proposal’s focus on curtailment vs. efficiency[^3][^6].
- The inclusion of both estimation (appliance use, savings from actions) and planning (personalized plans) enables direct comparison of beliefs across task types, as required by RQ1 and H1.

**RQ2: Prediction of beliefs by individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy).**

- *Sections 3–5* use validated, multi-item scales: Berlin Numeracy Test[^3][^4], DeWaters \& Powers (2011) Energy Literacy (cognitive, affective, behavioral)[^3][^10], and MAILS-Short for AI literacy[^3][^9].
- These measures allow for robust correlational and regression analyses to test whether higher literacy/numeracy predicts more calibrated or critical beliefs about LLMs (H2a–H2c).

**RQ3: How perceptions of LLM accuracy and trust predict willingness to use LLMs for energy decisions.**

- *Sections 6, 7, and 9* capture perceived LLM accuracy, task-specific trust, and both past and intended use for energy tasks, providing the necessary variables to test H3 (e.g., mediation/structural models linking beliefs and trust to use intentions/frequency).

**RQ4: Mediation/moderation by general trust/distrust in AI.**

- *Section 8* includes the TPA (Jian et al., 2000) and the cognitive subscale of the Semantic Differential AI-Trust scale (Shang \& Hsieh, 2025), both validated and widely used[^3][^6].
- This enables testing whether general trust in AI mediates or moderates the relationship between specific LLM beliefs and use intentions (H4).


## Survey Construction Strengths

- **Item selection:** Draws on gold-standard, validated measures for all individual difference constructs, ensuring reliability and comparability with prior work[^3][^4][^9][^10].
- **Custom items:** Where no validated scale exists (e.g., LLM accuracy/utility for energy tasks), items are closely modeled on established measurement approaches (Attari et al., 2010; DeWaters \& Powers, 2011) and pilot-tested in related studies[^3][^10].
- **Task-specificity:** LLM perception and trust items are explicitly tied to energy estimation and planning, not generic AI, directly addressing the proposal’s focus.
- **Logical flow:** The order moves from background/demographics to individual differences, then to LLM perceptions, trust, and finally behavioral intentions, minimizing priming and cognitive fatigue[^3][^4][^5][^6].
- **Feasibility:** The total item count and estimated time (20–25 minutes) are appropriate for online administration and participant retention[^3][^4].


## Coverage of Hypotheses

- **H1:** Directly testable by comparing perceived LLM accuracy for curtailment vs. efficiency actions (Section 6).
- **H2a–c:** Individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy) can be modeled as predictors of LLM belief calibration and criticality (Sections 3–5, 6).
- **H3:** Regression/mediation models can link LLM-specific accuracy/trust beliefs to use intentions/frequency (Sections 6, 7, 9).
- **H4:** General AI trust (Section 8) can be tested as a mediator/moderator in the above relationships.

**In summary:**
This survey instrument integrates the best validated scales and custom items from multiple drafts and the literature, ensuring comprehensive, reliable, and targeted measurement of all constructs required by the research questions and hypotheses. The structure and content are well justified by both the theoretical framework and empirical precedent[^3][^4][^6][^9][^10].
