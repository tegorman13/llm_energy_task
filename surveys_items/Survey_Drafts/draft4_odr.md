Thanks for the clarification. I’ll compile a full survey instrument in pandoc markdown format, suitable for a 20–30 minute administration window with a general adult sample. The survey will be divided into logically ordered sections, with approximately 20% of items addressing individual differences (e.g., literacy and numeracy), 45% on AI/LLM perceptions, and 35% on energy-specific judgments and behaviors. I’ll label each section with the source and indicate which items are custom.

I’ll let you know once it’s ready for review.


# Survey on AI Assistants in Household Energy Planning

Welcome to the survey! In this study, we are interested in your thoughts and experiences regarding AI assistants (like ChatGPT or Claude) and how they might help with household energy estimation and planning. You will be asked about your background, your opinions on AI (large language models), and your views on managing home energy. The survey should take about 20–30 minutes to complete. Thank you for your participation.
