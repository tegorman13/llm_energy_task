This report outlines how the constructed survey instrument addresses the research questions (RQs) and informs the hypotheses (H) presented in the study proposal.

## Addressing Research Questions (RQs)

  * **RQ1: Prevailing lay beliefs concerning LLM accuracy and utility for energy tasks (estimation & planning) and differentiated trust.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Primarily addressed by sections "[Beliefs about LLMs for Energy Estimation (Task A)](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23beliefs-about-llms-for-energy-estimation-task-a)" and "[Beliefs about LLMs for Energy Planning (Task B)](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23beliefs-about-llms-for-energy-planning-task-b)".
      * **Justification:** These sections contain custom items specifically designed to measure perceived accuracy (Q4, Q5, Q8, Q10, Q11), perceived utility (Q7, Q15), and task-specific trustworthiness (Q6, Q13, Q14) for both appliance energy estimation (Task A) and personalized plan generation (Task B). Questions Q9 and Q16 probe underlying mental models related to how LLMs might perform these tasks. The distinct sections for Task A and Task B allow for analysis of how beliefs differ between providing specific factual/quantitative information versus generating comprehensive, personalized plans, directly addressing the second part of RQ1. Items Q6 and Q13 specifically measure trust differentiated by task.

  * **RQ2: Predictive role of individual differences (numeracy, energy literacy, AI literacy) on lay beliefs.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Requires correlating scores from "[Energy Literacy](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23energy-literacy)", "[AI Literacy](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23ai-literacy)", and "[Numeracy](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23numeracy)" sections with the belief scores derived from the Task A and Task B sections.
      * **Justification:** The survey includes validated instruments or representative items to measure objective numeracy (Berlin Numeracy Test, Q80-Q83), multidimensional energy literacy (Cognitive, Affective, Behavioral subsets from DeWaters & Powers, Q17-Q30), and AI literacy (MAILS-Short Form, Q31-Q40). Statistical analysis (e.g., correlation, regression) of scores from these sections against the perceived accuracy, utility, and trust scores from the Task A/B sections will directly assess the predictive relationships proposed in RQ2.

  * **RQ3: Joint influence of perceived LLM accuracy and task-specific trust on willingness/frequency of use.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links belief scores from Task A/B sections (e.g., Q4, Q5, Q6, Q10, Q11, Q13) with the outcome measures in "[Willingness and Frequency of Use](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23willingness-and-frequency-of-use)" (Q84-Q87).
      * **Justification:** The survey measures perceived accuracy (Q4, Q5, Q10, Q11) and task-specific trust (Q6, Q13) for both energy tasks. It also includes custom items assessing self-reported willingness to use LLMs for these tasks in the future (Q84, Q85, Q86) and self-reported frequency of past use (Q87). Analyzing how accuracy and trust perceptions jointly predict willingness and frequency scores (e.g., using regression models) directly addresses RQ3.

  * **RQ4: Mediation/Moderation role of general AI trust/distrust.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Utilizes scores from "[General Trust in AI](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23general-trust-in-ai)" (TPA items Q41-Q52; Semantic Differential items Q53-Q79) in relation to the pathway identified in RQ3 (specific beliefs -\> willingness/frequency).
      * **Justification:** The survey includes established measures for general trust (TPA captures factors like reliability, confidence, integrity) and distrust (TPA also includes items on deceptiveness, suspicion; the Semantic Differential scale captures broader cognitive and affective trust/distrust dimensions). Statistical mediation and moderation analyses can be performed using scores from this section to examine whether general trust/distrust influences the relationship between task-specific beliefs (from Task A/B sections) and use intentions/behavior (from Willingness/Frequency section), as proposed in RQ4.

## Informing Hypotheses (H)

  * **H1: Laypeople perceive LLMs as relatively accurate, but perceptions reflect human biases.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Primarily informed by belief ratings in Task A (Q4, Q5) and potentially Task B (Q10). Comparison with objective accuracy or expert benchmarks (external data) would be needed, but the *perception* of accuracy is measured. Item Q8 (likelihood of significant error) also informs this. Items related to Attari et al.'s estimation task within Energy Literacy (if included in a task-based version) or custom items probing bias perception (like Q9, Q16) can explore the second part of H1.
      * **Justification:** High mean scores on perceived accuracy items (Q4, Q5, Q10) would support the first part of H1. Analyzing patterns in perceived accuracy across different appliance types (if measured more granularly) or through specific bias perception items could provide evidence regarding the reflection of human biases (e.g., if LLMs are perceived as less accurate for high-energy vs. low-energy items).

  * **H2a: Higher numeracy correlates with better-calibrated assessment.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links Numeracy scores (Q80-Q83) with the *variability or extremity* of accuracy ratings in Task A (Q4, Q5, Q8).
      * **Justification:** This hypothesis predicts a relationship between numeracy skills and the nature (less extreme, potentially more accurate *if objective data were available*) of accuracy beliefs for quantitative tasks. Analysis will involve correlating numeracy scores with the mean, variance, or extremity of responses to quantitative accuracy perception items.

  * **H2b: Higher energy literacy correlates with more critical/skeptical evaluation.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links Energy Literacy scores (Q17-Q30, especially cognitive Q17-Q22) with belief ratings in Task A and Task B (particularly accuracy Q4, Q5, Q10, Q11 and trust Q6, Q13).
      * **Justification:** This hypothesis predicts that domain knowledge (energy literacy) enables more critical assessment. Analysis will involve correlating energy literacy scores with perceived accuracy and trust, expecting negative correlations (higher literacy -\> lower perceived accuracy/trust, i.e., more skepticism).

  * **H2c: Higher AI literacy correlates with more cautious/nuanced beliefs.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links AI Literacy scores (MAILS-Short, Q31-Q40, esp. items on understanding limitations/ethics like Q35, Q40) with belief ratings (Task A/B) and general trust (TPA/Semantic Differential).
      * **Justification:** Higher scores on MAILS facets related to critical evaluation (e.g., Understand AI, AI Ethics) are expected to correlate with lower perceived accuracy/trust (more caution). High scores on Use & Apply facets might correlate positively, as hypothesized. This allows testing the association between understanding AI limitations and specific beliefs about LLMs in the energy context.

  * **H3: Favorable beliefs (accuracy, trust) predict willingness to use.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Links Task A/B belief scores (Q4-Q7, Q10-Q15) with Willingness/Frequency scores (Q84-Q87).
      * **Justification:** This hypothesis predicts a direct positive relationship. Correlations and regressions between perceived accuracy, utility, task-specific trust, and willingness/frequency items will test this directly.

  * **H4: General trust mediates the relationship between specific beliefs and willingness/frequency.**

      * **Survey Sections:** Uses General Trust scores (TPA, Semantic Differential) as a mediator in the relationship tested for H3.
      * **Justification:** The survey measures both specific beliefs (Task A/B sections) and general AI trust/distrust. Mediation analysis can test the proposed pathway: Specific Beliefs -\> General Trust -\> Willingness/Frequency.

In conclusion, the survey instrument is structured to gather data pertinent to each research question by including validated scales for individual differences and general trust, alongside custom-developed items targeting the specific lay beliefs and behavioral intentions relevant to LLMs in the household energy domain. The selection and ordering are designed to be logical while aiming for a manageable run-time for participants.
