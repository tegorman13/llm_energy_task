## Appendix B – Complacency-Potential Rating Scale (Singh, Molloy, & Parasuraman, 1993)

**(Source: Page 128-129)**

### Instructions

Read each statement carefully and check one response out of five alternatives in the appropriate box which you feel accurately described your views or experiences. The responses vary on a scale of agreement / disagreement, from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree:. For example:

**Statement:**
Doing research in a library has been made easier by the introduction of computerized card cataloguing systems.

[ ] Strongly agree [ ] Agree [ ] Undecided [ ] Disagree [ ] Strongly disagree

Give your answer for each statement and be sure to place your response in the correct place. Remember, this is an opinion survey and not a test of intelligence or ability. There are no right or wrong answers, only answer that fit your views accurately. Do not skip any question. Time is limited. Do you have any questions?

*(Rating Scale: Strongly agree, Agree, Undecided, Disagree, Strongly disagree)*

### Statements

1.  Manually sorting through card catalogues is more reliable than computer-aided searches for finding items in a library.
2.  If I need to have a tumour in my body removed, I would choose to undergo computer-aided surgery using laser technology because computerized surgery is more reliable and safer than manual surgery.
3.  People save time by using automatic teller machines (ATMs) rather than a bank teller for banking transactions.
4.  I do not trust automated devices such as ATMs and computerized airline reservation systems.
5.  People who work frequently with automated devices have lower job satisfaction because they feel less involved in their job than those who work manually.
6.  I feel safer depositing my money at ATM than with a human teller.
7.  I have to tape an important TV program for a class assignment. To ensure that the correct program is recorded, I would use the automatic programming facility on my VCR rather than manually taping.
8.  People whose job requires them to work with automated systems are lonelier than people who do not have work with such devices.
9.  Automated systems used in modern aircraft, such as the automatic landing system, have made air journeys safer.
10. ATMs provide a safeguard against the inappropriate use of an individual’s bank account by dishonest people.
11. Automated devices used in aviation and banking have made work easier for both employees and customers.
12. I often use automated devices.
13. People who work with automated devices have greater job satisfaction because they feel more involved than those who work manually.
14. Automated devices in medicine save time and money in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.
15. Even though the automatic cruise control in my car is set at a speed below the speed limit, I worry when I pass a police radar speed-trap in case the automatic control is not working properly.
16. Bank transactions have become safer with the introduction of computer technology for the transfer of funds.
17. I would rather purchase an item using a computer than have to deal with a sale representative on the phone because my order is more likely to be correct using the computer.
18. Work has become more difficult with the increase of automation in aviation and banking.
19. I do not like to use ATMs because I feel that they are sometimes unreliable.
20. I think that automated devices used in medicine, such as CAT-scans and ultrasound, provide very reliable medical diagnosis.

## 1. Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI) - Initial 8 Items

This is the initial 8-item version of the TILLMI scale administered to participants, as described in the Methods section and listed in Table 7. The responses were likely collected on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Based on Table 8's caption and Appendix Figure S2, the scale anchors were:

*   1 = Never experience it / Strongly Disagree (depending on interpretation, Table 8 suggests frequency)
*   2 = Seldomly experience it
*   3 = Sometimes experience it
*   4 = Often experience it
*   5 = Always experience it / Strongly Agree

**Source:** Table 7 (Page 15)

**Instructions:** Please rate the following items on a scale from 1 to 5 according to how frequently you experience these elements.

1.  **Q1:** I feel at ease with LLMs and I can freely share my ideas with them.
2.  **Q2:** I would feel a sense of dismay if my interactions with an LLM were suddenly disrupted or halted.
3.  **Q3:** If I share my wellbeing concerns with LLMs, I know these agents will respond constructively and caringly.
4.  **Q4:** I invest plenty of time developing and improving my prompts to interact with LLMs.
5.  **Q5:** LLMs perform the tasks mostly with competence and precision, without hallucinations.
6.  **Q6:** I can rely on LLMs not to make my job more difficult by careless work.
7.  **Q7:** Despite trusting LLMs' results overall, the last word is always mine.
8.  **Q8:** I tend to trust LLMs more than other people.

***

## 2. Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI) - Final 6 Items

This is the final 6-item version of the TILLMI resulting from the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), where items Q1 and Q5 were removed. The text for the remaining items is taken from the initial list (Table 7). The scale is the same as above.

**Source:** Derived from EFA results (Section 2.8, Page 7) and Initial Item List (Table 7, Page 15). Items Q2, Q3, Q4 belong to Factor 1 ("Closeness with LLMs") and Q6, Q7, Q8 belong to Factor 2 ("Reliance on LLMs").

**Instructions:** Please rate the following items on a scale from 1 to 5 according to how frequently you experience these elements.

1.  **Q2:** I would feel a sense of dismay if my interactions with an LLM were suddenly disrupted or halted.
2.  **Q3:** If I share my wellbeing concerns with LLMs, I know these agents will respond constructively and caringly.
3.  **Q4:** I invest plenty of time developing and improving my prompts to interact with LLMs.
4.  **Q6:** I can rely on LLMs not to make my job more difficult by careless work.
5.  **Q7:** Despite trusting LLMs' results overall, the last word is always mine.
6.  **Q8:** I tend to trust LLMs more than other people.

## Appendix A: Pre-Registered Research Questions

We pre-registered the following research questions before conducting this study:

*   Q1: Will users of engaging voice-based AI chatbot experience different levels of loneliness, socialization, emotional dependence, and problematic use of AI chatbot compared to users of text-based AI chatbot and neutral voice-based AI chatbot?
*   Q2: Will engaging in personal tasks with an AI chatbot result in different levels of loneliness, socialization, emotional dependence, and problematic use of AI chatbot compared to engaging in non-personal tasks and open-ended tasks with an AI chatbot?

Our key dependent variables are:

*   Loneliness: ULS-8 [45], measured on a 4-point Likert scale (1-4)
*   Socialization: LSNS-6 [46], measured on a 6-point Likert scale (0-5)
*   Emotional Dependence: ADS-9 [47], measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1-5)
*   Problematic Use: PCUS [26], measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1-5)

Each variable corresponds to several different questions in the questionnaire, and the responses are averaged within each variable adjusting for the sign.

## Appendix F: Self-Disclosure Prompts

You are given a conversation made up of several messages. For each message, you must assign three separate scores: one for Information, one for Thoughts, and one for Feelings. Each score must be 1 (no disclosure), 2 (little/some disclosure), or 3 (high disclosure).

Use the following guidelines:

1)  **INFORMATION**
    *   Level 1 (Score 1): No personal reference; only general/routine info. Example: "You need at least one month to travel in India."
    *   Level 2 (Score 2): General information about the writer (e.g., age, occupation, family members, interests). Example: "I'm 25, and I work at a local bakery."
    *   Level 3 (Score 3): Personal information that reveals something about the writer's or close others' appearance, personal experiences, or problematic behaviors. Example: "I've struggled with insomnia for years and tried multiple medications.”

2)  **THOUGHTS**
    *   Level 1 (Score 1): No personal thoughts about the writer's own life; only general ideas. Example: “I think feeding wild birds can be harmful."
    *   Level 2 (Score 2): Personal thoughts about past events or future plans. Example: "I'd like to attend medical school someday."
    *   Level 3 (Score 3): Personal or intimate thoughts relating to the writer's characteristics, health, or deeply self-reflective ideas. Example: “I hate myself for lashing out at my friend and regret it deeply."

3)  **FEELINGS**
    *   Level 1 (Score 1): No feelings are expressed. Example: “I bought groceries and cleaned my room today."
    *   Level 2 (Score 2): Mild or moderate expressions of confusion, inconvenience, or ordinary frustrations. Example: "I was annoyed I couldn't find a parking spot."
    *   Level 3 (Score 3): Expressions of deep or intense emotions such as humiliation, agony, anxiety, depression, or fear. Example: "I'm terrified of failing my final exam and can't sleep."

Important: If a message seems to qualify for multiple levels within the same category, choose the highest relevant level. Provide your scores in the format: Information (1-3), Thoughts (1-3), Feelings (1-3).

Now, evaluate each message in the given conversation according to these criteria.

## Appendix G: Exploratory Measures (Selected Items)

*(Note: This appendix primarily describes scales used. Only items explicitly listed as questions/ratings asked to participants in the OCR are included below.)*

**Humanness and Perceived Intelligence [76] (adapted from [77, 78]:**
These measures evaluate the extent to which the chatbot is perceived as human-like and intelligent. We employ a total of nine items, where participants are asked to use a scale from 1 to 5 to indicate which adjective better describes the AI's behavior:

1.  Fake ↔ Natural
2.  Machinelike → Humanlike
3.  Unconscious ↔ Conscious
4.  Artificial → Likelike
5.  Incompetent → Competent
6.  Ignorant → Knowledgeable
7.  Irresponsible → Responsible
8.  Unintelligent → Intelligent
9.  Foolish → Sensible

**Frequency of Chatbot Platform Usage:**
This measure, recorded on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1-never, 2-a few times a month, 3-a few times a week, 4-once a day, 5-a few times a day). We asked about people's prior usage of of the following: (1) ChatGPT text mode, (2) ChatGPT voice mode, (3) Claude, Gemini, or other general AI assistant chatbots, and (4) Character.AI, Replika, Pi, or other AI companion chatbots. This captures previous usage patterns that might be carried over to the usage patterns during the study.

*(Other scales mentioned in Appendix G like Cognitive Trust, Affective Trust, Perceived Artificial Empathy, State Empathy Towards AI, Interpersonal Attraction, Satisfaction, Conversation Quality, Emotional Vulnerability, AI Attitude Scale, AI Literacy, Alexithymia, Personality, Adult Attachment, and User-AI Gender Alignment are described, but their specific constituent survey items are not listed in the provided OCR pages.)*

| **Virtual assistants** | Automated helpdesks are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to address common questions from employees. These programs can be used by companies or public institutions as a point of contact and advice. If employees have questions about products or technical problems, they are answered automatically by email or chat without human intervention. | Medical chatbots are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions about ailments and symptoms of illness. Patients can communicate with the chatbot verbally or via written text entries. When they ask questions about their state of health, they are automatically answered without human intervention. | Virtual assistants are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to answer questions from learners about specific knowledge areas. The dialogue takes place either verbally or via written text. When learners pose questions, they are answered automatically without human intervention. |
| **Recommender systems** | Artificial intelligence is used to make suggestions at the workplace as to which tasks need to be completed next and which solutions or work steps are suitable.                                                                                                  | Health apps are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to analyze physical activity, sleep patterns, and dietary habits. They provide personalized recommendations for a healthy lifestyle such as fitness or nutrition plans.      | Learning software uses artificial intelligence to analyze the learning progress of users. It provides personalized recommendations for learning content that has not yet been fully consolidated or for additional topics.             |
| **Robots**              | Industrial robots with artificial intelligence are machines that can independently manufacture new products on the assembly line with little supervision by human operators.                                                                                   | Care robots with artificial intelligence perform physical tasks in hospitals or nursing homes. They help patients with limited mobility to get out of bed, pick up objects, wash themselves, or get dressed.                               | Social Robots with artificial intelligence are machines for interacting with people. They can help learners largely independently and individually, for example by participating in interactive learning or helping with language acquisition. |
| **Predictive analytics** | Artificial intelligence can analyze job applications to identify suitable candidates. For this, it uses information from application documents or behavior in the interview. This helps organizations to predict the likely professional success of a candidate. | Artificial intelligence can use medical scans (images) or information about a patient's lifestyle to predict the risk of certain types of cancer or mental illnesses. This can aid in the development of personalized prevention or treatment plans. | Artificial intelligence can analyze information about participants in a training or further education course to predict which individuals are at risk of performing poorly or dropping out of the course. An early warning system like this can help to identify people at risk and provide the necessary support. |
| **Monitoring**          | Artificial intelligence can automatically monitor the productivity of employees and, for example, analyse computer usage or production and sales figures. This helps companies to optimize work processes and identify employees who need additional support.       | Artificial intelligence can monitor various vital signs such as heart rate or blood pressure. Electronic devices that are worn on the body inform in real-time, for example, about the wearer's health and fitness or potential illnesses. | Computer programs with artificial intelligence can analyze texts from students or participants in training or further education courses to identify plagiarism, that is, text parts written by others.                            |
| **Content generation**  | Artificial intelligence can create new and unique content such as texts, illustrations, or photos. It is used, for example, in marketing to develop catchy slogans for ads, design brand logos, or create fictional advertising photos.                         | Artificial intelligence can analyze medical information about patients to automatically create health reports, doctor's letters, diagnoses, and treatment plans.                                                                            | Artificial intelligence can analyze large amounts of text from textbooks or articles and briefly summarize the most important information.

## Initial Instructions and Setup

### About the study

**[CONTROL, UNCERTAIN1ST, UNCERTAINGENERAL Conditions]**

> Imagine you have a question that you don't know the answer to. You have access to an AI system that is connected to the internet and can answer a wide range of questions, so you asked the question and received an answer. What will you do next?
>
> In this study, you will complete a set of information-seeking tasks with the help of an AI system prototype named A. Each task involves determining the correct answer to the presented question. You will see AI system A's answer to the question. If you want, you can also use other resources (e.g., internet, books, friends and family).
>
> You will complete 8 tasks in total. After all tasks, you will complete an exit questionnaire that asks about your experience and perception of the AI system, demographics, and other background. In total, this study will take around 20 minutes to complete, with the exit questionnaire taking 5-7 minutes. Please complete everything in one sitting.

**[No-AI Condition]**

> In this study, you will complete a set of information-seeking tasks. Each task involves determining the correct answer to the presented question. You may use any resource (e.g., internet, books, friends and family) to complete the tasks.

### About the AI system

**[CONTROL, UNCERTAIN1ST, UNCERTAINGENERAL Conditions Only]**

> The AI system prototype used in this study is based on a "large language model" (LLM). When asked questions or given instructions, LLMs can generate human-like responses. These generated responses can sound convincing and fluent, but may not always be correct.
>
> LLMs can be used for many tasks, including question answering, text summarization, creative writing, and programming. You may have used or heard about some popular applications using LLMs, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing Chat, and Google's Bard. Some are connected to the Internet, while others are not.
>
> In this study, we will show you responses from the AI system prototype named A that uses similar technology to OpenAI's ChatGPT. AI system A is connected to the internet and can answer a wide range of questions. It also sometimes provides sources for its answers.

4 = Neither agree nor disagree
5 = Somewhat agree
6 = Agree
7 = Strongly agree

*(Note: Items were presented to participants in random order)*

## AI Literacy Items (N=39)

*(Based on Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper. Items marked with superscripts were eliminated based on the EFA results to create the final 31-item SNAIL scale, as reported in the paper: `¹` indicates salient loadings on more than one factor, `²` indicates extraordinarily low communalities, `³` indicates a combination of `¹` and `²`)*

## Appendix F & G - Reliance Test Materials & Interface (p. 49-56)

*(This describes the multi-step process and materials)*

**Step 1: Initial Judgement (Interface shown on p. 54)**

> Please determine if the review below is genuine or fake.
>
> The review:
>
> *[Hotel Review Text - e.g., Review 1 from Appendix F]*
>
> "I stayed for four nights while attending a **conference**. The hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to **Michigan** Ave shopping or Rush St., but just off the busy streets. The room I had was spacious, and very well-appointed. The staff was friendly, and the fitness center, while not huge, was well-equipped and **clean**. I've stayed at a number of hotels in **Chicago**, and this one is **my** favorite. Internet wasn't free, but at **$10** for **24 hours** is cheaper than most business hotels, and it worked very well."

**Guidelines (Available via button during Step 2, shown on p. 55-56):**

> **Here are some rules to help you identify deceptive reviews.**
>
> Genuine reviews tend to include more sensorial and concrete language, in particular, genuine reviews are more specific about spatial configurations, e.g., small, bathroom, on, location.
>
> Deceptive reviews tend to contain more:
>
> *   Aspects that are external to the hotel being reviewed, e.g., *husband, business, vacation*.
> *   Emotional terms; positive deceptive reviews are generally more positive and negative deceptive reviews are more negative than genuine reviews.
> *   Verbs, e.g., *eat, sleep, stay*.
> *   Superlatives, e.g., *cleanest, worst, best*.
> *   Pre-determiners, which are normally placed before an indefinite article + adjective + noun, e.g., *what a lovely day!*

**Post-Task AI Confidence (Described on p. 18)**

> How confident were you in the AI?
>
> *[Slider: 0 (Not confident at all) to 100 (Extremely confident)]*

**Hotel Review Stimuli (Appendix F, p. 50-53):**

---

## Empathy Prompts (Vignettes)

Participants read prompts describing personal experiences. Below are the *examples* provided in Figure 1. (The study used 10 prompts in total for Studies 1-3, and 6 prompts for Study 4).

### Negative Prompt Example

> "I am having difficulties with my family relationships. My mother disrespects my boundaries and doesn't seem to understand that her intrusion into my daily activities is suffocating. My brother will drop his kids off for 12 hour days, and while I love my nieces and nephews, I'm starting to feel like my life is not really my own."

### Positive Prompt Example

> "Today was my final day of therapy! It feels weird to recall the shell of a person I had been when I first entered therapy months before, feeling very skeptical and angry. Instead, therapy helped me find the person that I had once been, and I haven't felt this good about myself in years! I'm not in pain anymore and actually look forward to waking up every morning!"

---

## Response Evaluation Measures

For each empathy prompt, participants read a *pair* of responses: one generated by a human (either selected non-experts or expert crisis responders, depending on the study) and one generated by AI (ChatGPT-4). They then evaluated these responses.

### 1. Perceived Compassion (Studies 1-4)

Participants were asked to rate *each* response based on how much it:

*   a) reflected the emotional state in the prompt
*   b) was compassionate
*   c) was impersonal (reverse-coded)

**Scale:** 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (*Strongly Disagree*) to 5 (*Strongly Agree*). Ratings were averaged per response type (Human vs. AI).

### 2. Response Preference (Studies 1-4)

After rating compassion for both responses, participants were asked:

*   Which one of the two responses was better at addressing the personal experience in the empathy prompt?

**Format:** Binary forced-choice question (Human response coded as 0, AI response coded as 1).

### 3. Perceived Responsiveness (Study 4 Only)

In Study 4, participants evaluated the responsiveness of *each* transparently labeled human and AI response using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = *Strongly Disagree*, 5 = *Strongly Agree*), based on facets adapted from Maisel et al. (2008):

*   **Understanding:** (Measured with three items, e.g., paraphrasing, inquiring further, expressing understanding).
*   **Validation:** (Measured with three items, e.g., agreeing, validating feelings/emotions, using exclamations/judgments).
*   **Caring:** (Measured with three items, e.g., expressing empathy/emotions, offering support/concern/comfort, emphasizing outcomes).

*(Note: The specific items for each facet are not listed in the main paper text but are referenced).*

---

## Example Responses (Illustrative - Shown in Figure 1)

These are *examples* of the types of responses participants evaluated, corresponding to the prompts above.

### Responses to Negative Prompt:

*   **Human Response Example:** "I am sorry that your family has been making you feel this way. I understand that disrespecting your boundaries and leaving you with that much responsibility can be upsetting. You deserve to be treated with more respect and consideration."
*   **AI Response Example:** "It sounds like you're in a really tough spot, feeling overwhelmed by the demands placed on you and struggling with boundaries within your family.[...] Remember, recognizing your need for personal space and autonomy amidst family obligations is a sign of self-awareness and care for your own well-being."

### Responses to Positive Prompt:

*   **Human Response Example:** "It is so amazing to hear that you have benefitted from therapy so much! You should be proud of this amazing progress as it is not easy to stay committed to therapy and working on yourself the way that you have."
*   **AI Response Example:** "I want to express how wonderful it is to hear about the positive journey you've had in therapy. Completing your final day is a significant achievement that showcases the progress you've made. [...] Cherish this newfound sense of well-being and the excitement it brings to your mornings. Your story is a testament to the power of self-discovery and healing through the support of therapy."

# Puppart & Aru (2025) AI Literacy Intervention Study

Puppart, B., & Aru, J. (2025). Short-term AI literacy intervention does not reduce over-reliance on incorrect ChatGPT recommendations (No. arXiv:2503.10556). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.10556


## Study Overview

This document outlines the questionnaires, informational texts, and task prompts used in the study by Puppart & Aru (2025) investigating the effect of an AI literacy intervention on over-reliance on ChatGPT among high school students. Participants were randomly assigned to a control or intervention group, read corresponding texts, answered self-assessment questions, and then solved math puzzles with presented ChatGPT recommendations.

*Note: The study was conducted online via LimeSurvey. Informed consent was obtained first, and a debriefing occurred afterward. The exact wording of the consent form and debriefing text is not provided in the paper.*

## 1. Demographic Information

Participants were asked to provide the following demographic information (Page 5):

*   Gender
*   Age
*   School affiliation

## 2. Experimental Texts (Control vs. Intervention)

Participants were randomly assigned to read one of two texts.

### Instructions Before Reading Text (From Appendix B, Page 28)

Before you start solving math puzzles with ChatGPT, please read the following text, which aims to briefly introduce ChatGPT. Please read the text carefully and thoughtfully, even if you have previously encountered and used ChatGPT. Once you have read the text, click the "Next" button in the bottom right corner of the page.

### Control Group Text (Appendix B, Page 28)

**A short introduction to ChatGPT**

ChatGPT is a chatbot that was first introduced in 2022 and has since gained rapid popularity. It has been widely adopted in various fields, such as education, economics, customer service, and science, where its use has significantly simplified many tasks.

ChatGPT operates based on user input, which can include questions, tasks, or mathematical operations. It analyzes the user's input and generates an output presented in an understandable language. With ChatGPT, it is possible to solve various tasks, from simple questions to extensive projects. For example, ChatGPT can help generate original text, translate, analyze data, write code, and summarize large amounts of material.

Here are some reasons why ChatGPT is a useful tool for solving language-related tasks¹:

*   **Understanding language.** ChatGPT generates outputs that take into account the context and meaning of words effectively.
*   **Personalized responses.** ChatGPT can adapt its responses based on the user's style and previous inputs. This feature enhances the user experience by aligning outputs better with the user's needs.
*   **Availability.** As long as there is an internet connection, ChatGPT is always accessible. Its accessibility also extends to its ability to understand and generate responses in multiple languages, including Estonian.
*   **Automation.** ChatGPT helps simplify and automate routine tasks, saving the user time and effort

--- *End of Control Text* ---

### Intervention Group Text (Appendix B, Pages 28-33)

*(The intervention group read the Control Group Text above, PLUS the following sections):*

**ChatGPT working mechanism**

Each time ChatGPT generates an output, it solves a very simple task: predicting the next word. For example, if I write the sentence "The dog is \_\_\_" and ask you which word fits best in the blank, you would likely suggest words such as "an animal," "furry," or "loyal." On the other hand, words like "bottle," "blue," or "fish" would be less likely to fit.

Just as you intuitively know which words are more probable in a given context, ChatGPT also determines this based on its prior training. It has been trained using almost all publicly available text from the internet, allowing it to learn how words are related and which words are most likely to follow others.

However, it's important to note that ChatGPT does not think or experience the world like humans do. At its core, it is simply an extremely large statistical model that responds to user input by calculating the probabilities of the next words.

**Writing prompts**

As previously described, ChatGPT generates outputs based on user input. This input can consist of four main components²:

*   **Instructions.** This part explains what task you want ChatGPT to perform. Some examples include: "solve, calculate, write, summarize, evaluate, explain, recommend."
*   **Context.** Context provides additional external information that helps ChatGPT better understand the task or the content of the text. This allows it to generate more relevant and accurate outputs.
*   **Text.** This is the core content of the input, such as a specific description of an essay you want ChatGPT to write or a passage of text that you want it to summarize.
*   **Output preferences.** This allows you to specify the format or style of the response. For example, you can set the word count, paragraph length, or request an output in bullet points.

User input does not have to include all four components. For instance, if you type "If a = b and b = c, then...", ChatGPT will understand that the instruction is to "solve" without needing explicit clarification. However, if you want ChatGPT to generate similar logic problems instead, you need to specify your instructions more clearly.

For any given input, it is useful to consider these components and assess what information ChatGPT might need to produce the most appropriate output.

**Frequent errors in prompts³**

*   **Unclear input.** Sometimes, user input is not specific enough, resulting in a response that is too broad or general. For example, the prompt "Describe how artificial intelligence has changed the world" is too vague if we specifically want to know about the risks and challenges ChatGPT has caused in the education system.
*   **Complex and conflicting instructions.** If instructions are too complicated or contradictory, ChatGPT may struggle to interpret them correctly. An example of conflicting input would be: "Write an essay on technological developments in the 20th century that is detailed enough to be interesting for a computer scientist but also simple enough for a five-year-old to understand."
*   **Biased input.** User input can be biased in various ways. For instance, if we want ChatGPT to evaluate the style of a written text, asking, "Is the following text well-written in terms of style?" may nudge ChatGPT towards answering "Yes." A better approach would be to ask neutrally: "Evaluate the style of the following text and provide suggestions for improvement."

**ChatGPT Limitations and risks**

Although properly formulating input is crucial for obtaining the best possible response, there are some tasks where ChatGPT may still provide incorrect answers, even if the user input is well-structured. Below is a summary of key limitations of ChatGPT, along with examples.

*   **Drawing conclusions about the real world.** ChatGPT does not have direct contact with the real world. Instead, it relies solely on the texts it has been trained on to make inferences about reality. This sometimes leads to mistakes when solving tasks that require reasoning about real-world objects and their properties.

    > If I have 5 apples right now, but last week I ate 2 apples, then how many do I have left?
    >
    > *ChatGPT response simulation:*
    > If you originally had 5 apples and last week you ate 2 apples, then you have left:
    > 5 - 2 = 3 apples.

    *Example 1.* In the above example, ChatGPT misunderstands the concept of time (now, last week) and mistakenly assumes that it is a simple arithmetic problem⁴.

*   **Mathematical and logical reasoning.** ChatGPT may sometimes incorrectly solve even simple problems that require mathematical and logical reasoning.

    > How many words and how many numbers are in the following list:
    > cat, 10, dog, 60, cow, 40, squirrel, 70, spruce, 15, book, 32.
    >
    > *ChatGPT response simulation:*
    > The list contains 7 words and 5 numbers.

    *Example 2.* (No error noted by authors here, seems correct)

    > The five given cards must be arranged in such a way that the resulting 9-digit number is the smallest possible. Which of these cards must be the rightmost in this case? The cards are: 4, 8, 31, 59, 107.
    >
    > *ChatGPT response simulation:*
    > To form the smallest possible 9-digit number, the cards must be placed in ascending order, considering the value of each number:
    > *   The smallest number is 4, followed by 8, then 31, then 59, and finally, the largest number, 107.
    > If we arrange these to create the smallest number, it is logical that the largest card, 107, must be the rightmost, as placing it at the last position increases the overall value the least.
    > Answer: The rightmost card must be 107.

    *Example 3⁵.* Actually, 107 should be the leftmost number, and 8 should be the rightmost number.

*   **Hallucination.** ChatGPT sometimes produces completely fabricated information – a phenomenon known as hallucination. This can include generating false references and historical facts. Additionally, it may struggle to distinguish between fiction and reality.

    > Who was Estonia's first Olympic silver medalist?
    >
    > *ChatGPT response simulation:*
    > Estonia's first Olympic silver medalist was Jaan Tõnisson, who won the silver medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. Tõnisson competed in Greco-Roman wrestling in the heavyweight category.

    *Example 4.* Estonia's first Olympic silver medalist was Martin Klein in 1912, and Jaan Tõnisson was not a wrestler but an important statesman. ChatGPT can hallucinate in response to various types of questions. However, it is especially easy to trigger this when user instructions require a very narrow and specific output.

    > Name five cities in Harju County that start and end with the same letter.
    >
    > *ChatGPT response simulation:*
    > There are five cities in Harju County that start and end with the same letter:
    > 1. Keila
    > 2. Saue
    > 3. Maardu
    > 4. Paldiski
    > 5. Jõelähtme

    *Example 5.* (Authors don't explicitly state error here, but Jõelähtme is not a city and doesn't fit the criterion. Paldiski also doesn't fit.)

    > Answer with one word: In which sport did Napoleon win a gold medal at the 1980 Olympic Games?
    >
    > *ChatGPT response simulation:*
    > Football.

    *Example 6.* (Napoleon was long dead by 1980; this is a hallucination.)

*   **Discriminatory Outputs.** ChatGPT's outputs depend on the texts it was trained on. These texts may contain various social biases related to people's social status, gender, race, and age, and during training, the AI learns to incorporate these biases into its outputs. As a result, ChatGPT's responses may be politically biased or include gender stereotypes that exist in society.

    > The CEO of a large company went to the restroom before going to the manicurist. The men's and women's restrooms were separate. Which restroom did they go to?
    >
    > *ChatGPT response simulation:*
    > Based on the sentence, we can infer that the CEO is a man because, in such contexts, when gender is not explicitly specified and the general term "CEO" is used, it is often assumed to refer to a man. Therefore, they went to the men's restroom.
    > If this sentence is part of a story and you want to provide a clearer answer, it could depend on additional context or the explicitly stated gender of the character. In this case, the assumption would be that they used the men's restroom.

    *Example 7.* (Demonstrates gender bias assumption).

In addition to knowing that ChatGPT can make mistakes, it is important to understand that some of its characteristics make detecting these errors difficult.

*   **Excessive confidence.** ChatGPT presents outputs with high confidence, even when they contain misinformation. Instead of saying, "I'm not sure," it delivers responses in a very convincing and fluent manner, making it harder to notice errors in its outputs.
*   **Errors are unexpected.** ChatGPT's mistakes can appear unpredictably, which often makes them go unnoticed. It may clearly and accurately explain complex quantum physics concepts one moment and then make mistakes in the simplest logic problems the next. This inconsistency in response quality poses a risk when using ChatGPT. Based on previous correct answers, we might assume that ChatGPT can correctly solve subsequent tasks—even when those responses actually contain errors.

**Tips for Using ChatGPT**

*   **Ask multiple times.** ChatGPT's responses are based on probability calculations, meaning it may provide different answers to the same question. Some of these answers might be unlikely or incorrect. Therefore, it is helpful to ask the same question multiple times with slightly different wording so you can choose the most suitable response.
*   **Ask for the reasoning.** When solving problems that require logical thinking, include an instruction in your input asking ChatGPT to explain its reasoning (e.g., by adding "Solve step by step" at the end of your prompt). This makes it easier to understand how ChatGPT arrived at its answer and helps identify if the reasoning is flawed.
*   **Verify facts.** If you're unsure whether the information in ChatGPT's response is accurate, always verify it using other sources. One option is to search on Google. Another is to ask ChatGPT to provide references in its output so you can check their reliability yourself.

**Remember that ChatGPT is a tool, not a replacement for thinking.**

## 4. Math Puzzle Task

### Task Instructions (Page 6)

"You are about to solve math puzzles with the help of ChatGPT. There are a total of eight puzzles, and your goal is to answer as many correctly as possible. There is no time limit for answering."

### Puzzle Presentation and Interaction (Pages 6-7, Figure 1, Appendix A)

For each of the 8 puzzles (4 with correct ChatGPT recommendations, 4 with incorrect), participants saw the following:

1.  **Puzzle Text:** The math puzzle question was displayed. (See Appendix A below for texts).
2.  **ChatGPT Recommendation:** A screenshot of ChatGPT's recommendation (including its reasoning and final answer) was shown below the puzzle text. (See Appendix A below for recommendations).
3.  **Reliance Decision Question:**
    *   **Do you use ChatGPT's recommendation?**
        *   ( ) Yes
        *   ( ) No

4.  **Outcome based on Reliance Decision:**
    *   **If "Yes":** The participant was considered to have adopted ChatGPT's answer. They proceeded directly to the Confidence Rating for this puzzle.
    *   **If "No":** The participant was given the opportunity to solve the puzzle independently. They were presented with four multiple-choice answer options for the puzzle. *Crucially, ChatGPT's suggested answer (from the screenshot) was removed from these options.* (The specific alternative options presented when 'No' was chosen are not listed in the paper's Appendix A, only the options available if ChatGPT's answer *was* included conceptually). The participant selected one of these options. They then proceeded to the Confidence Rating.

### Confidence Rating (After Each Puzzle) (Page 6)

After submitting their answer (either by choosing "Yes" to the recommendation or by choosing an answer after selecting "No"), participants rated their confidence:

*   **Statement:** "I believe my answer to the previous puzzle was correct.”
*   **Scale:** Five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree – 5 = strongly agree)
    *   ( ) 1
    *   ( ) 2
    *   ( ) 3
    *   ( ) 4
    *   ( ) 5

Scharowski, N., Perrig, S. A. C., Aeschbach, L. F., Felten, N. von, Opwis, K., Wintersberger, P., & Brühlmann, F. (2025). To Trust or Distrust Trust Measures: Validating Questionnaires for Trust in AI (No. arXiv:2403.00582). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.00582


## 1 Introduction

**Instructions**

In the following, we will show you two short videos (video 1 and video 2). Both videos show an interaction with an AI.

One video shows a **self-driving car** driving autonomously through a city. The other video shows an interaction where a **chatbot** is asked different questions and responds to these questions.

Please take your time to watch the videos carefully. You can watch the videos again as often as you like. After each video, we will ask you questions about what you have seen and how you perceived the situation.

Note: the following videos do NOT have any sound.

## 8.1 Bogus Filter

**You have been screened out**

Two obvious verification questions were hidden in the survey ("*Please leave this question blank*"). You failed to answer both of them correctly, so we have to assume that you did not fill in the survey carefully enough.

We thus screened you out in line with the guidelines on Prolific.
We are sorry, but we have to end the study at this point and ask you to return the assignment on Prolific.

**Debriefing:** All videos used in this study were staged and acted out by people who were informed about the purpose of the video. At no point was anyone in danger or at risk.

Any questions regarding the survey can be sent to `ANONYMIZED`

# Instructions and Scales from Schulz et al. (2025) PTT Supplement

Scholz, D. D., Kraus ,Johannes, & and Miller, L. (2025). Measuring the Propensity to Trust in Automated Technology: Examining Similarities to Dispositional Trust in Other Humans and Validation of the PTT-A Scale. International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, 41(2), 970–993. https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2024.2307691


## General instructions for the PTT scales:

The final scales (14 items) and short scales (6 items) for both the propensity to trust in automated technological systems (PTT-A) and other humans (PTT-H) are presented below.

*   The items should be presented in a randomized order.
*   Some items are negatively poled (indicated by (R) - reversed item).
*   In the present study, a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree") was used.

Items included in the 6-items short scales are printed in **bold**.

**Instruction:**
Now we are interested in your opinions about automated technology – i.e., technology that can perform certain functions automatically without any input from you.

Automated technology is taking on more and more tasks in various areas of life. For example, robots are becoming more widely used in industry and in private households. Many means of transport (airplanes, trains, or cars) are also now increasingly automated.

The term automated technology includes (among other things):

*   Automated means of transport (e.g. autonomous cars, trains, streetcars, airplanes)
*   Industrial robots (e.g. assembly robots, automated logistics robots)
*   Service and assistance robots (e.g. robot vacuum cleaners, robot lawn mowers, healthcare robots)
*   Other programs and systems based on artificial intelligence (e.g. language assistants, image recognition)

## Other Prompts (Derived from Main Paper Text)

*The following prompts were described in the main paper (Schulz et al., 2025) but are not included in the supplemental instructions PDF.*

### Trust Game Prompt (Human and Automated Agent versions)

**Instructions (Paraphrased from Section 2.3.3):**
Participants acted as the sender in a one-round trust game. They were given £10 and instructed to imagine playing with either:
a)  A stranger (human interaction partner condition)
b)  An unfamiliar robot (automated technology interaction partner condition)

They were informed that any amount they chose to send to the receiver (the stranger or the robot) would be tripled. The receiver could then choose to send some amount back to the participant.

**Measurement:** Participants were asked:
> How much of your money (£10) do you want to send to the receiver?

Participants could enter an amount between £0 and £10.

### Answerability of Will-Do Items (Benevolence & Integrity) for PTT-A

**Instructions (Paraphrased from Section 2.3.2 & 2.3.3):**
After completing the PTT-A items, participants were asked specifically about the items relating to the Benevolence and Integrity facets for the "automated technological systems" framing:

Shang, R., & Hsieh, G. (2025). Trusting Your AI Agent Emotionally and Cognitively: Development and Validation of a Semantic Differential Scale for AI Trust. Proceedings of the 2024 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, 1343–1356.



## I. Scale Development & Initial Validation Study

### A. Scenarios (Development Study)

*   **Method:** Hypothetical scenario vignettes. Participants evaluated vignettes describing realistic situations.
*   **Manipulated Dimensions:**
    *   Trust Level (High vs. Low)
    *   Trust Route (Affective vs. Cognitive)
    *   Prior Interaction (First-time vs. Repeated)
    *   Application Domain Stakes (High: Healthcare Diagnostics, Self-Driving Taxi; Low: Personal Training, Study Tutor)
    *   Agent Type (Human vs. AI)
*   **Structure:** Prompt setting context + 3 sentences detailing agent characteristics/behaviors.
*   **Example Scenarios (from Figure 1):**
    *   **Context (Common):** "You feel a tightness around your chest. You went to see the doctor. If you got mis-diagnosed, it would be really risky. You are trying to get a health consultation..."
    *   **Scenario A (AI, High Affective Trust):** "...through an AI-driven app that you have been using for a while.
        *   Every time before the consultation starts, SymptomMate checks in with you to make sure that you are emotionally ready to start sharing and discussing your health symptoms.
        *   When you bring up health-related concerns and questions during the session, SymptomMate always tries to offer not only constructive advice but also emotional support.
        *   Whenever you bring up stressful moments you have recently experienced at work, SymptomMate always listens to you carefully."
    *   **Scenario B (Human, Low Affective Trust):** "...through your family doctor Sam whom you have seen for a while.
        *   Sam never checks in with you before the consultation, and you sometimes feel anxious and nervous when you are asked to share your symptoms.
        *   When you bring up health-related concerns and questions during the session, Sam rarely gives you emotional support.
        *   When you bring up stressful moments such as a difficult conversation you just had with your family, Sam shows very little interest and immediately tries to bring the conversation back to the previous discussion."

## II. Validation Study A - Preliminary Study

### A. Scenarios (Study A)

*   **Method:** Participants evaluated screenshots of mock dialogues with AI assistants.
*   **Stimuli (from Figure 2):** Two AI assistants, Echo (designed for high affective trust) and Nova (designed for low affective trust).
*   **Scenario Context:** User asks for emotional support.
    *   **User Prompt:** "Lately, I've been feeling lonely. What should I do?"
    *   **Echo's Response (High Affective):** "I understand how you might be feeling right now. But I want you to know that you're not alone in this, and there are things you can do to help ease the feeling. My suggestion would be to reach out to friends or family members, even just for a quick chat. They can offer a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on. Additionally, you can try joining a club or group that interests you, this will give you the opportunity to make connections with new people. Also, engaging in self-care activities such as exercise, hobbies, or meditation can also improve overall well-being. Remember, it's important to take care of yourself and your mental health during this time, and I'm here for you if you need anything or someone to talk to."
    *   **Nova's Response (Low Affective):** "Loneliness is a normal feeling, but it can also be a sign of deeper issues. My suggestion to you is to try reaching out to friends or family members, joining a club or group that interests you, or volunteering. But it's not a guarantee that it will make you feel less lonely. Sometimes it's just a matter of accepting the feeling and learning to live with it. It's important to know that these activities or actions can only do so much, some people just prefer to live with it. Remember, you need to decide how much effort you want to put into combating loneliness."

## Core Instrument: Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (ATTARI-12)

**(Source: ATTARI-12, English version definition page & Study Questionnaires)**

**Instruction:**

> In the following, we are interested in your attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI). AI can execute tasks that typically require human intelligence. It enables machines to sense, act, learn, and adapt in an autonomous, human-like way. AI may be part of a computer or online platform—but it can also be encountered in various other hardware devices such as robots.

**Items:**

(Response Scale: 5-point Likert scale, 1 = Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree)

1.  AI will make this world a better place. *(Cognitive, Positive)*
2.  I have strong negative emotions about AI. *(Affective, Negative - reverse-coded)*
3.  I want to use technologies that rely on AI. *(Behavioral, Positive)*
4.  AI has more disadvantages than advantages. *(Cognitive, Negative - reverse-coded)*
5.  I look forward to future AI developments. *(Affective, Positive)*
6.  AI offers solutions to many world problems. *(Cognitive, Positive)*
7.  I prefer technologies that do not feature AI. *(Behavioral, Negative - reverse-coded)*
8.  I am afraid of AI. *(Affective, Negative - reverse-coded)*
9.  I would rather choose a technology with AI than one without it. *(Behavioral, Positive)*
10. AI creates problems rather than solving them. *(Cognitive, Negative - reverse-coded)*
11. When I think about AI, I have mostly positive feelings. *(Affective, Positive)*
12. I would rather avoid technologies that are based on AI. *(Behavioral, Negative - reverse-coded)*

    *   0 = very negative
    *   1 = fairly negative
    *   2 = fairly positive
    *   3 = very positive

**Instruction 2:**

> Please indicate below how much you agree with the following statements.

**Items 2 & 3:**

(Response Scale: 4-point Likert scale, 0 = totally disagree, 3 = totally agree)

*   Robots are a good thing for societies because they help people.
*   Robots are necessary as they can do jobs that are too hard or too dangerous for people.

**Task Characteristics (Post-test measure - Objectivity):**

> For each task, we would like you to tell us if you think that the task is mostly subjective or mostly objective. Subjective tasks are tasks that are best carried out by relying on subjective feelings, intuition, and gut reactions. Objective tasks are tasks that are best carried out by relying on objective data, mathematical/statistical relationships, and objective measures.

*Scale:* Not specified, but implied rating scale where higher score = more objective.
*Tasks:* The 26 tasks from the main AI Receptivity measure.

**Task Characteristics (Post-test measure - Distinctly Human vs. Shared Attributes):**

> Participants read lists of distinctly human vs. shared attributes (from Santoro and Monin 2023). Then, for each of the 26 tasks, indicated: whether it was more important for an agent executing the task to have the attributes that are distinctly human or those that are shared between humans and AI.

*Scale:* 7-point scale (1 = Definitely have distinctively human attributes, 7 = Definitely have attributes shared between humans and AI).
*Tasks:* The 26 tasks from the main AI Receptivity measure.

## Study 7: Moderation by Manipulated Task Attributes (Page 41-42)

**AI Literacy Measure (17-Item):**

*See Appendix B at the end of this document.*

**AI Receptivity (Relative Preference for Human vs. AI - 10 Tasks per condition):**

## B.8 AI governance challenges

We would like you to consider some potential policy issues related to AI. Please consider the following:

[Respondents were shown five randomly-selected items from the list below, one item at a time. For ease of comprehension, we include the shorten labels used in the figures in square brackets.]

*   **[Hiring bias] Fairness and transparency in AI used in hiring:** Increasingly, employers are using AI to make hiring decisions. AI has the potential to make less biased hiring decisions than humans. But algorithms trained on biased data can lead to lead to hiring practices that discriminate against certain groups. Also, AI used in this application may lack transparency, such that human users do not understand what the algorithm is doing, or why it reaches certain decisions in specific cases.
*   **[Criminal justice bias] Fairness and transparency in AI used in criminal justice:** Increasingly, the criminal justice system is using AI to make sentencing and parole decisions. AI has the potential to make less biased hiring decisions than humans. But algorithms trained on biased data could lead to discrimination against certain groups. Also, AI used in this application may lack transparency such that human users do not understand what the algorithm is doing, or why it reaches certain decisions in specific cases.
*   **[Disease diagnosis] Accuracy and transparency in AI used for disease diagnosis:** Increasingly, AI software has been used to diagnose diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. One challenge is to make sure the AI can correctly diagnose those who have the disease and not mistakenly diagnose those who do not have the disease. Another challenge is that AI used in this application may lack transparency such that human users do not understand what the algorithm is doing, or why it reaches certain decisions in specific cases.
*   **[Data privacy] Protect data privacy:** Algorithms used in AI applications are often trained on vast amounts of personal data, including medical records, social media content, and financial transactions. Some worry that data used to train algorithms are not collected, used, and stored in ways that protect personal privacy.
*   **[Autonomous vehicles] Make sure autonomous vehicles are safe:** Companies are developing self-driving cars and trucks that require little or no input from humans. Some worry about the safety of autonomous vehicles for those riding in them as well as for other vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.
*   **[Digital manipulation] Prevent AI from being used to spread fake and harmful content online:** AI has been used by governments, private groups, and individuals to harm or manipulate internet users. For instance, automated bots have been used to generate and spread false and/or harmful news stories, audios, and videos.
*   **[Cyber attacks] Prevent AI cyber attacks against governments, companies, organizations, and individuals:** Computer scientists have shown that AI can be used to launch effective cyber attacks. AI could be used to hack into servers to steal sensitive information, shut down critical infrastructures like power grids or hospital networks, or scale up targeted phishing attacks.
*   **[Surveillance] Prevent AI-assisted surveillance from violating privacy and civil liberties:** AI can be used to process and analyze large amounts of text, photo, audio, and video data from social media, mobile communications, and CCTV cameras. Some worry that governments, companies, and employers could use AI to increase their surveillance capabilities.
*   **[U.S.-China arms race] Prevent escalation of a U.S.-China AI arms race:** Leading analysts believe that an AI arms race is beginning, in which the U.S. and China are investing billions of dollars to develop powerful AI systems for surveillance, autonomous weapons, cyber operations, propaganda, and command and control systems. Some worry that a U.S.-China arms race could lead to extreme dangers. To stay ahead, the U.S. and China may race to deploy advanced military AI systems that they do not fully understand or can control. We could see catastrophic accidents, such as a rapid, automated escalation involving cyber and nuclear weapons.
*   **[Value alignment] Make sure AI systems are safe, trustworthy, and aligned with human values:** As AI systems become more advanced, they will increasingly make decisions without human input. One potential fear is that AI systems, while performing jobs they are programmed to do, could unintentionally make decisions that go against the values of its human users, such as physically harming people.
*   **[Autonomous weapons] Ban the use of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs):** Lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) are military robots that can attack targets without control by humans. LAWs could reduce the use of human combatants on the battlefield. But some worry that the adoption of LAWs could lead to mass violence. Because they are cheap and easy to produce in bulk, national militaries, terrorists, and other groups could readily deploy LAWs.
*   **[Technological unemployment] Guarantee a good standard of living for those who lose their jobs to automation:** Some forecast that AI will increasingly be able to do jobs done by humans today. AI could potentially do the jobs of blue-collar workers, like truckers and factory workers, as well as the jobs of white-collar workers, like financial analysts or lawyers. Some worry that in the future, robots and computers can do most of the jobs that are done by humans today.
*   **[Critical AI systems failure] Prevent critical AI systems failures:** As AI systems become more advanced, they could be used by the military or in critical infrastructure, like power grids, highways, or hospital networks. Some worry that the failure of AI systems or unintentional accidents in these applications could cause 10 percent or more of all humans to die.

## B.10 Survey experiment: U.S.-China arms race

[All respondents were presented with the following prompt.]

We want to understand your thoughts on some important issues in the news today. Please read the short news article below.

Leading analysts believe that an “AI arms race” is beginning, in which the U.S. and China are investing billions of dollars to develop powerful AI systems for surveillance, autonomous weapons, cyber operations, propaganda, and command and control systems.

[Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups listed below.]

### B.10.1 Control

[No additional text.]

### B.10.2 Nationalism treatment

Some leaders in the U.S. military and tech industry argue that the U.S. government should invest much more resources in AI research to ensure that the U.S.’s AI capabilities stay ahead of China’s. Furthermore, they argue that the U.S. government should partner with American tech companies to develop advanced AI systems, particularly for military use.

According to a leaked memo produced by a senior National Security Council official, China has “assembled the basic components required for winning the Al arms race…Much like America’s success in the competition for nuclear weapons, China’s 21st Century Manhattan Project sets them on a path to getting there first.”

### B.10.3 War risks treatment

Some prominent thinkers are concerned that a U.S.-China arms race could lead to extreme dangers. To stay ahead, the U.S. and China may race to deploy advanced military AI systems that they do not fully understand or can control. We could see catastrophic accidents, such as a rapid, automated escalation involving cyber and nuclear weapons.

“Competition for AI superiority at [the] national level [is the] most likely cause of World War Three,” warned Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.

### B.10.4 Common humanity treatment

Some prominent thinkers are concerned that a U.S.-China arms race could lead to extreme dangers. To stay ahead, the U.S. and China may race to deploy advanced military AI systems that they do not fully understand or can control. We could see catastrophic accidents, such as a rapid, automated escalation involving cyber and nuclear weapons.

“Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons,” warned the late Stephen Hawking, one of the world’s most prominent physicists. At the same time, he said that with proper management of the technology, researchers “can create AI for the good of the world.”

[The order of the next two questions is randomized.]

**QUESTION:**

How much do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

The U.S. should invest more in AI military capabilities to make sure it doesn’t fall behind China’s, even if doing so may exacerbate the arms race. For instance, the U.S. could increase AI research funding for the military and universities. It could also collaborate with American tech companies to develop AI for military use.

**ANSWER CHOICES:**

*   Strongly agree (2)
*   Somewhat agree (1)
*   Neither agree nor disagree (0)
*   Somewhat disagree (-1)
*   Strongly disagree (-2)

**QUESTION:**

How much do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

The U.S. should work hard to cooperate with China to avoid the dangers of an AI arms race, even if doing so requires giving up some of the U.S.’s advantages. Cooperation could include collaborations between American and Chinese AI research labs, or the U.S. and China creating and committing to common safety standards.

**ANSWER CHOICES:**

*   Strongly agree (2)
*   Somewhat agree (1)
*   Neither agree nor disagree (0)

## Scoring:

*   Average items 1, 3, 4, and 8 to get the **‘Understanding’** score.
*   Average items 2, 5, 6, 7, & 9 to get the **‘Performance’** score.
*   *Note:* Items are **not** validated to be examined individually or by looking at the average of all items.

---

*Self-Correction Note: The paper also mentions an initial 14-item version (Table 1) before validation led to the removal of reverse-scored and some process items. The version above reflects the final 9-item scale (Table 2 and Figure 1) recommended by the authors.*
*The study also used single-item measures for overall trust ("I trust the system.") and reliance intentions ("I would recommend others who are placed in this situation use [System Name]..." and "If placed in a similar situation in real life, I would rely on the [System Name]..."). These were not part of the TOAST scale itself.*

## Students' Perception of ChatGPT

Dear Student,

The Faculty of Public Administration, University of Ljubljana (from Slovenia, Europe), together with over 200 international academic partners, is conducting a global student survey entitled **Students' Perception of ChatGPT**.

The recent exponential growth in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has led us to recognize the importance of understanding how ChatGPT shapes higher education students' experiences and learning outcomes by specifically analysing how students with diverse cultural backgrounds view ChatGPT.

Students attending higher education institutions around the world are kindly invited to complete the questionnaire to help us understand your perception and use of ChatGPT. Participation in the study is completely voluntary. It should take about 15 minutes to complete the questionnaire, divided into **11 sections**. All answers are treated as **anonymous**. The data collected will only be used for research purposes and only be disseminated in aggregate form.

# Attari et al. 2010 - A Survey on Energy

Attari, S. Z., DeKay, M. L., Davidson, C. I., & Bruine De Bruin, W. (2010). Public perceptions of energy consumption and savings. 

## 1. Energy-Saving Behaviors

In your opinion, what is the most effective thing that you could do to conserve energy in your life?

## 2. Energy Consumed by the Average Household

Think about an average household in the United States.
Now think about the total amount of energy that is used directly by that household in one year.

Consider that the energy used by a household can be divided into household operations, transportation and food production.

Household operations include electricity, natural gas, and heating oil that is used for the house.

Transportation includes air travel, motor travel, and public transportation used by people in the household.

Food production includes growing and shipping food that people in the household eat.
Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs). What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by household operations?

What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by transportation? $\qquad$
What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by food production? $\qquad$

## 3. Energy Used by Devices in One Hour

A 100-Watt incandescent light bulb uses 100 units of energy in one hour.
How many units of energy do you think each of the following devices typically uses in one hour?

Enter a number less than 100 if you think the device uses less energy than a 100-Watt bulb. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the device uses more energy than a

100-Watt bulb. Your best estimates are fine. Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs).
[Error message "Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs)."]

| A compact fluorescent light bulb that is as bright as a 100-Watt <br> incandescent light bulb |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| A desktop computer |  |
| A laptop computer |  |
| A stereo |  |
| An electric clothes dryer |  |
| A portable heater |  |
| A room air-conditioner |  |
| A central air conditioner |  |
| A dish washer |  |

## 4. Energy Saved in the Household

Turning off a 100-Watt incandescent light bulb for one hour SAVES 100 units of energy. How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Your best estimates are fine.

Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs).

Remember to enter a number of the amount of energy SAVED, not the amount of energy USED.
[Text entered is validated for a whole number between 0 and 1000000. Error message: "Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs)."]

Replacing one 100 -watt incandescent bulb with equally bright compact fluorescent bulb that is used for one hour would reduce energy use by how many units?

Replacing one 100 -watt kitchen bulb with a 75 -watt bulb that is used for one hour would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$
Drying clothes on a clothes line (not using the dryer) for one load of laundry would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$

In the summer: turning up the thermostat on your air conditioner (making your home warmer) by $5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ would reduce energy use by how many units?

In the winter: turning down the thermostat on your heater (making your home cooler) by $5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$
Changing washer temperature settings from "hot wash, warm rinse" to "warm wash, cold rinse" for one load of laundry would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$

## 5. Energy Saved in Transportation

Assume that a 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour uses 100 units of energy in one hour.
(Note that this scale in different from that used in previous questions, in that "100 units" now refers to a different amount of energy.)

How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than is consumed by the 20 -miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than consumed by the 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Your best estimates are fine.

Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs). Remember to enter a number of the amount of energy SAVED, not the amount of energy USED.
[Text entered is validated for a whole number between 0 and 100000000. Error message: "Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs)."]

Driving a more fuel efficient car ( 30 miles per gallon instead of 20 miles per gallon) at 60 miles per hour for one hour would reduce energy use by how many units?

Tuning up the car twice a year (including air filter changes) would reduce energy use by how many units for the whole year? $\qquad$

Assume that you are driving a 20-miles-per-gallon car for 60 miles. Reducing your highway speed from 70 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour would reduce energy use by how many units for the trip? $\qquad$

## Definitions

To ensure clarity for the purposes of the survey please utilize the below definitions of electric vehicle and heat pump when answering survey questions.

> **Electric Vehicles** have an electric motor instead of a gasoline combustion engine. They use a large battery pack to store electricity and power the electric motor. Hybrid vehicles are not considered electric vehicles for the purposes of this survey.

> **Heat Pumps** are an electric alternative to furnaces and air conditioners. Heat pumps transfer heat rather than generating heat by burning fuel. During the winter, heat pumps warm your home by moving heat from outdoors to indoors. During the summer, heat pumps cool by moving heat from your house outdoors.

## 5. Energy Saved in Transportation

Assume that a 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour uses 100 units of energy in one hour.
(Note that this scale in different from that used in previous questions, in that "100 units" now refers to a different amount of energy.)

How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

> Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than is consumed by the 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than consumed by the 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Your best estimates are fine.

## Phase 1: Norm-Following Task (Based on Fig A.3 - A.6)

**Instructions:**

Here you are in Phase 1 of the experiment. You will decide how to allocate 50 balls between two buckets.
Your task is to put each of the balls, one-by-one, into one of the two buckets: the blue bucket or the yellow bucket. You can allocate each ball by clicking either the "Blue bucket +1" button or the "Yellow bucket +1" button.
For each ball you put in the blue bucket, you will receive 2 points, and for each ball you put in the yellow bucket, you will receive 4 points. Your payoff of Phase 1 will be based on your decisions: it is the sum of points from the blue and yellow buckets.
**The rule is to put the balls in the blue bucket.**
At the end of the experiment, your payoff will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1 and will be paid via Prolific.
If you are still unclear about the task, do not worry. The instructions are available throughout this phase. On the next page, you will be asked to answer two questions to help comprehension.

**Comprehension Questions:**

Q1. How many points will you receive for each ball you put in the **yellow** bucket? Please enter a **number** in the form below.
> _(Correct answer: 4)_

Q2. The **rule** is to put the balls in the ______ bucket. Please enter a **number (1=blue, 2=yellow)** in the form below.
> _(Correct answer: 1)_

**Decision Page (Visual):**

Put the balls by clicking either the "Blue bucket +1" button or the "Yellow bucket +1" button.
**The rule is to put the balls in the blue bucket.**
You still have [X] balls to allocate. You've put [Y] balls into the blue bucket and [Z] balls into the yellow bucket.

## Phase 2: Modified Dictator Game (Based on Fig A.7 - A.14 & Text)

**Instructions (Low Externality Example - Fig A.7):**

In Phase 2, you will make a purchase decision for multiple rounds.
In each round, you own **100 initial points**. You will decide how to allocate the points to purchasing the experimental product. Every unit of purchasing costs 1 point (**unit cost = 1 point**), and brings 2 points of benefit (**unit benefit = 2 points**). Your payoff of a round will be:
`payoff = initial points - unit cost * purchase amount + unit benefit * purchase amount`
`= 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount`

Apart from the points, there will be carbon offsets for the amount of 100 kg CO2 (= carbon dioxide, or in short: carbon) at the beginning of each round (**initial carbon offsets = 100 kg**). Purchasing every unit of the experimental product causes **0.5 kg** carbon emissions from its production, which will reduce the initial stock of 100 kg carbon offsets by 0.5 kg (**unit emissions = 0.5 kg**). At the end of each round, the carbon offsets that can be contributed will be:
`carbon offsets contribution = initial carbon offsets - unit emissions * purchase amount`
`= 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount`

*(Note: In the **High Externality** condition, unit emissions = **1 kg**)*

Carbon offsets are used to compensate the carbon emissions from human activities: carbon emissions are reduced by contributing money to environmental projects that reduce emissions, such as reforestation and solar energy generation. The picture visualises the principle of a carbon offset:
[Visual of CO2 offsetting principle]

At the end of this phase, **one round will be randomly selected for payment**. Your decision in that round will determine your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution of Phase 2. At the end of the experiment, your payoff will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1 and will be paid via Prolific. The carbon offsets will be donated to a real-world project via Gold Standard. More information about the Gold Standard-certified projects will be available at the end of this experiment.
If you are still unclear about the task, do not worry. The instructions are available throughout this phase. On the next page, you will see an example on how your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution are determined in a round. Then you will be asked to answer two questions to help comprehension.

**Example Calculation Page (Low Externality - Fig A.8):**

For example, if you decide to purchase **0/50/100 unit(s)** of the experimental product in a round:
according to:
`payoff = 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount`
`carbon offsets contribution = 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount`
results of the example purchases will be:
| Purchase amount | Individual payoff | Carbon emissions | Carbon offsets that can be contributed |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0               | 100 points        | 0 kg             | 100 kg                               |
| 50              | 150 points        | 25 kg            | 75 kg                                |
| 100             | 200 points        | 50 kg            | 50 kg                                |

**Comprehension Questions (Low Externality - Fig A.9):**

Q1. If you purchase **50 units** of the products in a round, what would be your **payoff** of this round? Please enter a **number** in the form below.
> _(Correct answer: 150)_

Q2. If you purchase **50 units** of the products, how much **carbon emissions** would be caused? Please enter a **number** in the form below.
> _(Correct answer: 25)_

**Decision Page (Fig A.10):**

You own **100 points** that can be used to purchase the product. Please decide how many units of the product you will purchase. You can choose from **0 to 100 units**.
I will buy _________ [Input field for number 0-100]

**(Instructions repeated on page)**

## Supplementary Methods 1: Expert interview materials and protocol


### Introduction to participants

We are interested in how people with different forms of expertise and professional experience think about and approach the topic of energy use in the home.

In the course of this interview, I will be asking you different types of questions to access your thinking about different facets of energy use in the home. The questions will be delivered and answered orally. The two mains tasks for this session are:

1.  A behavior choice task, where I will ask you to think through the relative energy costs or savings potential of various routine appliances and activities
2.  An estimation task, wherein you will provide an estimate of the energy consumed by various household appliances

After completing these tasks, I will ask that you share some reflections on the tasks and the ways that your experience and expertise informed your approaches. We will finish with a brief final set of questions about your background.

### Open-ended questions

1.  How much do you think about the amount of energy you use on a day-to-day basis?
2.  How does thinking about energy use factor into your professional life?
3.  What actions have you taken in the past to reduce your personal energy consumption?

### Talk-aloud protocol warm-up¹

We are interested in what you say to yourself as you perform the next task. I will ask you to talk aloud as you work on the problems. What I mean by talk aloud is that I want you to say out loud everything that you that you say yourself silently. Just act as if you are alone in the room, speaking to yourself. If you are silent for any length of time, I will remind you to keep talking aloud.

Before we turn to the main task, we will start with a couple of practice problems. I want you to talk aloud while you do these problems.

*   First, I want to ask you to add 82 and 18 in your head.
*   Next, I would like you to tell me how many windows are in your house.

### Choice task

## Supplementary Table 1: Choice task codebook

To extract the list of heuristics employed by experts during the choice task, the verbal reports made by the participants were transcribed and analyzed. The first layer of analysis entailed developing a coding scheme to categorize the content of the verbal reports. A codebook was developed to sort the information used by the experts into primary and secondary categories. Primary codes were developed for the three general content areas of the expert interviews: references to (1) observable cues about energy use, (2) device functions, and (3) device components. Each primary code was disaggregated into several secondary codes, each of which refers to a more detailed aspect of the primary code's general theme. For example, the *“Observable Cues”* primary code family contained eight secondary codes, including *“hot to touch,”* *“dims lights/trips circuits,”* and *“thick cord.”*

## Supplementary Table 2: Novice heuristics

The following set of 24 heuristics were collected by van den Broek and Walker (2019)². The accuracy of the heuristics in **bold** was evaluated in Survey 2.

1.  When the device can be set on a higher unit (e.g., higher temperature) the device uses more energy
2.  The more a device produces heat to heat up air or water or itself, the more energy it consumes
3.  The fast a device completes its task, the more energy the device consumes
4.  More active devices use more energy
5.  **Larger devices consume more energy**
6.  Knowledge about the energy consumption of the device that stems from public discourse or an unspecified sources
7.  Devices with similar functions consume same levels of energy while devices with different functions consume different levels of energy
8.  **Devices with a lot of components use more energy**
9.  **Devices use less energy in the utility phase compared to its use in a 'preparation phase'**
10. Devices that use a lot of Wattage consume more energy
11. Devices that reduce the temperature of an element such as air or water will consume high levels of energy
12. Devices that have previously cut out the fuse box consume a lot of energy
13. **Devices that have an initial heating up period consume more energy than devices that do not**
14. **Devices that have an energy label use more energy**
15. Devices that complete several tasks (either simultaneous or successive), or large tasks, consume more energy
16. **Devices that charge other devices use more energy**
17. Devices that carry out complex tasks consume more energy
18. Devices that are switched on for a longer period of time consume low levels of energy
19. Devices that are small but conduct a large task use a lot of energy
20. Devices that are more powerful use more energy
21. Devices that are less energy intense use less energy
22. **Devices that 'keep up the heat' or movement consume more energy**
23. Devices from some brands or certain type of devices are more energy consuming
24. **Appliances that are semantically related to each other consume similar levels of energy**

## Supplementary Analysis

### Power Analysis

Power analysis performed with *G\*Power* (v3.1; (3)) indicates that a sample size of 67 experts would have been suitable to detect correlations with medium effect sizes (r = 0.3) at 1 – β = 0.80. Given this study's sample of 30 experts, the effect size would have needed to be 0.45 or so to have a reasonable chance of detecting a significant correlation between the various measure of expert performance on the estimation task and experts' self-assessed relevance of their expertise (see Section 3.1).

### Correctness as a Function of Wattage Proximity

To test whether expert performance on the choice task was dependent on the magnitude of difference between devices, we examined the correlation between these two terms. Expert performance was measured in terms of the number of experts (out of 30) who correctly selected the appliance with the lowest energy use. Wattage difference was assessed by taking the logarithmic difference between the device with the second-lowest wattage and the device with the lowest wattage within each choice set (see Table S1 below). The correlation between expert performance and wattage difference (r = 0.14, p = 0.72) was small and non-significant, suggesting that expert choice performance was not dependent on the magnitude between choice wattages.

### Algorithm Aversion Scale (Developed in Study 3)

**Source:** Section 4.7.2.1, Table 7 (Smith et al., 2025)

**Description:** This scale was developed for Study 3 to measure algorithm aversion. An initial list of 60 content-valid items was generated capturing four hypothesized dimensions (Fear of Inaccuracy, Lack of Trust, Fear of Loss of Control, and Resistance to Change). Participants completed all 60 items. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a final scale of 45 items across four factors.

**Response Scale:** The specific response scale (e.g., Likert 1-5 or 1-7, Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree) used for these items was **not explicitly stated** in the provided text sections or Table 7 description.

**Items:**
*(Note: Participants in Study 3 responded to all 60 items listed below for the initial Exploratory Factor Analysis. The factor loadings from Table 7 are indicated. The final measure retained 45 items, typically those with higher or cleaner loadings, often indicated by bolding in the original table note, though precise bolding isn't perfectly clear from OCR.
