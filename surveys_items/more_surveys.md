# current study proposal

This proposal investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as effective external aids for household energy decisions by examining how laypeople‚Äôs mental models of LLM competence, shaped by well-documented misperceptions of energy use (Attari et al., 2010) and bounded-rationality accounts of consumer judgment (Blasch et al., 2019), interact with individual differences in objective numeracy, multidimensional energy literacy, and AI literacy. Four core questions anchor the work: (a) what users believe about LLM accuracy in estimating appliance-level consumption and generating personalized conservation plans; (b) how numeracy, energy literacy, and AI literacy predict those beliefs; (c) whether accuracy beliefs and task-specific trust translate into self-reported willingness and recent frequency of LLM use for energy tasks; and (d) whether general trust or distrust in AI mediates or moderates these belief‚Äìbehavior links. The key hypotheses posit that users will overestimate LLM accuracy in ways echoing their own range-compression biases (H1), that higher numeracy and literacies will yield more calibrated‚Äîoften more skeptical‚Äîassessments (H2a‚Äìc), that favorable accuracy and trust beliefs will drive intended and reported use (H3), and that global AI trust will partly explain or shape this relationship (H4), thereby clarifying when LLMs help or hinder energy-saving behavior through the lens of calibrated trust theory (Lee & See, 2004).

Your study proposal is highly interdisciplinary and theory-driven, integrating:

- **Energy-specific decision biases and literacy** *(e.g., Attari et al., Blasch et al., DeWaters & Powers)*  
- **Cognitive psychology concepts like numeracy and bounded rationality**  
- **Emerging AI trust and use dynamics**, especially as applied to **LLMs**

It calls for **multi-construct measurement** of:
1. **LLM-specific trust and accuracy beliefs** (task-specific trust in AI)
2. **Numeracy**
3. **Energy literacy**
4. **AI literacy**
5. **General trust in AI**
6. **LLM use intent and use frequency**

Below is an evaluation of which existing surveys best apply, **which gaps exist**, and **new instruments or adaptations** you should consider adding.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Surveys for Your Study

### 1. **Numeracy**
- **Best survey**: **Berlin Numeracy Test** (Cokely et al., 2012)
  - **Why**: Strong predictor of decision accuracy and risk literacy (fits your H2 reasoning).
  - **Format**: 4 short items, validated across populations.
  - **Alternative**: **Lipkus Numeracy Scale** ‚Äì longer, more math-focused.

---

### 2. **Energy Literacy**
- **Best survey**: **DeWaters & Powers Energy Literacy Instrument**
  - Covers 3 domains:
    - **Cognitive** (objective knowledge about energy)
    - **Affective** (attitudes toward energy use)
    - **Behavioral** (self-reported conservation behaviors)
  - **Why**: Multidimensional and validated among lay populations (matches your interest in literacy and behavior).

- **Supplement with**:
  - **Attari et al. (2010)'s energy use estimation task**
    - Add as a **behavioral benchmark** for perception bias around appliance use (ducking range compression).
    - Format: "Estimate how much energy a hair dryer uses per hour."

---

### 3. **AI Literacy**

- **Best survey**: **AI Literacy Scale (AILS)** ‚Äì Ng et al. (2021)
  - Includes:
    - Understanding of basic AI principles
    - Awareness of AI risks/biases
    - Self-efficacy when interacting with AI
  - **Why**: Fits your hypothesis that AI literacy predicts more calibrated accuracy beliefs and trust.

- **Limitations**:
  - Modest psychometric development (but usable).
  - Focuses on general AI‚Äîmay not capture **LLM-specific knowledge**.

---

### 4. **Trust in AI (General and Task-Specific)**

- **General Trust in AI**:
  - Use: **Glikson & Woolley‚Äôs Trust in AI Scale**
    - 4 subscales: Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Explainability
    - Reliable measure across diverse AI settings.
  - **Why**: Matches your interest in trait-level trust mediating behavior (H4).

- **Task-Specific Trust in LLMs**:
  - You‚Äôll need to **design or adapt a task-specific instrument**.
  - Recommendations:
    - Items like:  
      - ‚ÄúHow confident are you that ChatGPT's estimation of X appliance usage is correct?‚Äù  
      - ‚ÄúHow likely are you to follow ChatGPT‚Äôs suggested energy-saving plan?‚Äù
    - Use 5‚Äì7 point Likert scales for rating:
      - **Perceived accuracy**
      - **Usefulness**
      - **Trustworthiness**
      - **Confidence following recommendations**

  ‚îÇ Consider adapting trust dimensions from **Lee & See (2004)**:  
  - Competence  
  - Predictability  
  - Responsibility

---

### 5. **LLM Use: Intentions and Self-Reported Frequency**

- **No off-the-shelf instruments for LLM use in energy settings** exist.

#### So, include custom self-report items such as:
- "In the past month, how often have you used ChatGPT (or similar) to get advice about saving energy or using appliances?"
- "Next time you need guidance about an energy appliance, how likely are you to use ChatGPT for help?"

Use a validated scale format:
- Behavioral Frequency (Never ‚Üí Daily)
- Behavioral Intentions (Very unlikely ‚Üí Very likely)

These mirror behavioral intention questions from **TAM / UTAUT** models:
- Davis (1989); Venkatesh et al. (2003)

| LLM Use Frequency & Intention | Custom | 4‚Äì6 | Subjective |
| LLM Knowledge | Custom quiz | 5‚Äì10 | Objective |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation Summary

You are in a strong position to proceed using **validated instruments** for:
- Numeracy
- General AI trust
- Energy literacy
- Appliance estimation
- AI literacy (general)

You'll need to **design short custom instruments** to capture:
- **Task-specific trust in LLMs**
- **Actual and intended LLM use**
- **LLM-specific knowledge/competence beliefs**

Base these on **user perception**, **TAM trust**, and **calibrated trust theory** items. Ensure you pilot these scales before large-scale data collection to verify clarity and variability.

Let me know if you'd like help drafting **sample items** for the custom LLM trust and use subscales.

**Outlining survey instrument structure**

To best measure various constructs, I'll begin with an introductory summary paragraph. Then, I‚Äôll follow up with sections detailing measurement requirements and a proposed primary instrument battery.

Under each subsection:

* AI literacy could use the short form of MAILS, or AILQ.
* For energy literacy, I'll lean toward ELS or ELQ, with the Attari appliance knowledge task.
* Objective numeracy fits well with BNT.
* General AI trust can benefit from TPA-Revised and Semantic-Differential Trust.
* For LLM-specific trust, the TILLMI scale seems like a solid choice.
  I'll also recommend an optional AI self-efficacy scale and automation bias behavioral tasks.

**Crafting the answer with citations**

To avoid overwhelming, I‚Äôll summarize the recommended instruments and include citations clearly next to each measure. I should also note that the user prefers a summary table, but I‚Äôll keep it brief, avoiding excessive use of tables. The citations will be linked to each instrument, like:

* MAILS citation: (website).
* AILQ citation: (website).
* TPA-R validation: (website).
* ‚Ä¶ and so on.

I‚Äôll take care to include proper referencing for every measurement description, ensuring consistency and accuracy.


**Summarizing the instruments**

I want to make sure the user gets a concise summary of the recommended instruments, so I‚Äôll provide a shorter summary first. The user likes tables, so I‚Äôll add one at the end for clarity, but I‚Äôll be careful not to overuse them. Each measurement needs to have citations to ensure thoroughness. I‚Äôm focusing on balancing detail and brevity while making sure I reference everything properly, avoiding overwhelming the user with too much information.


Thought for 1m 23s


The proposal already covers most of the necessary constructs, but a few strategic substitutions and two additional scales will sharpen construct coverage, shorten respondent burden, and give you direct leverage on LLM-specific trust. The table at the end consolidates the full recommended battery.

## 1  Mapping Proposal Constructs to Best-Fit Instruments

### 1.1  Predictor Variables

* **Objective numeracy ‚Äì Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT).** Four adaptive Bayesian-reasoning items discriminate well at the high-ability end while taking ‚âà3 min to complete (Cokely et al., 2012) ([Society for Judgment and Decision Making][1]).
* **Multidimensional energy literacy ‚Äì Energy Literacy Scale (ELS, short-form).** A 28-item Rasch-scaled instrument covering knowledge, affect, and behaviour is more survey-friendly than the 60-item ELQ while retaining comparable reliability (Œ± ‚âà .90) ([ResearchGate][2]).
* **Appliance knowledge ‚Äì Attari kWh-Estimation Task.** Open-ended kWh/year estimates for 15 benchmark appliances, scored as log-error, remain the field standard for range-compression bias (Attari et al., 2010) ([PNAS][3]).

### 1.2  AI-Related Individual Differences

* **AI literacy ‚Äì MAILS short form (18 items).** Retains the six core competencies (Understand, Use, Detect, Create, Ethics, Self-regulation) with Œ± ‚âà .88 and CFA invariance across education levels (Carolus et al., 2023) ([ScienceDirect][4]).

  * *Optional depth*: If you need granular affective facets, add the AILQ‚Äôs ‚Äúempathy‚Äù and ‚Äúagency‚Äù subscales (32 items in total) (Design & Validation Team, 2024) ([Bera Journals][5]).

### 1.3  Mediators & Moderators (Trust / Distrust)

* **General AI trust/distrust ‚Äì TPA-Revised (12 items) plus Semantic-Differential AI-Trust (27 bipolar pairs).** The two together separate cognitive trust, affective trust, and distrust, and show strong factorial validity in AI contexts (Hoffman et al., 2024; Strohm et al., 2025) ([arXiv][6], [ACM Digital Library][7]).
* **LLM-specific trust ‚Äì Trust-in-LLMs Index (TILLMI, 6 items).** Newly validated two-factor scale (‚Äúcloseness‚Äù & ‚Äúreliance‚Äù) provides task-specific coverage unavailable in generic trust batteries (De Duro et al., 2025) ([arXiv][8]).
* **AI self-efficacy ‚Äì AISES (22 items).** Useful covariate because self-efficacy amplifies adoption even when trust is low (Wang & Chuang, 2024) ([ACM Digital Library][9]).

### 1.4  Outcome & Behaviour Measures

* \*\*LLM energy-use adoption ‚Äì Adapt five frequency items from KPMG‚Äôs Global AI Study (e.g., ‚ÄúHow often did you use an LLM for work in the past month?‚Äù) and two concealment items (‚ÄúHave you hidden LLM use from a supervisor?‚Äù) (Gillespie et al., 2025) ([KPMG Assets][10]).

### 1.5  Calibration & Over-/Under-Reliance

* **Perceived accuracy & trust** ‚Äì Use four custom Likert items per appliance (‚ÄúHow accurate would ChatGPT‚Äôs estimate be for *this* appliance?‚Äù) plus two plan-level items.
* **Behavioural overreliance check** ‚Äì Embed a short web-based *explanation-gating* task: participants review a fictitious LLM‚Äôs appliance estimate, optionally click a ‚Äúshow rationale‚Äù button, then decide whether to accept or override. Prior work shows the design captures omission/commission errors within 3‚Äì4 min (Bu√ßinca et al., 2021) ([ScienceDirect][11]). For deeper validation, you could pilot a two-trial **Radar-Monitoring Automation-Bias Task** adapted from Mosier & Skitka (1996) ([ScienceDirect][12]), but the simpler gating task is usually sufficient in survey settings.

## 2  Gaps & Optional Add-Ons

| Gap                        | Instrument                                                                      | Rationale                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Uncertainty perception** | Four verbal-probability vignettes from Kim et al. (2024) (‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, but‚Ä¶‚Äù) | Captures mental-model sensitivity to LLM confidence statements, complements accuracy beliefs ([arXiv][13]) |
| **Technology acceptance**  | Short UTAUT-2 four-item behavioural-intention block                             | Useful if you seek comparability with past adoption studies; drop if length is a concern                   |

## 3  Practical Recommendations

1. **Length control.** The core battery (BNT + ELS + MAILS-S + Attari + TPA-R + Semantic-Differential + TILLMI + AISES + KPMG items + explanation-gating task) runs ‚âà20 min for MTurk/Prolific participants; dropping AISES trims ‚âà3 min.
2. **Order effects.** Place behavioural tasks (Attari, gating) before self-report to minimise demand characteristics; randomise trust blocks to avoid acquiescence clustering.
3. **Scoring alignment.** Compute log-error for Attari estimates and rescale to z-scores before interaction terms to prevent heteroskedasticity in moderated-mediation models.

**Bottom line:** swapping the long ELQ for the shorter, Rasch-scaled ELS, adding the LLM-focused TILLMI, and embedding a brief behavioural gating task will give the study precise construct coverage without overburdening respondents‚Äîall while aligning cleanly with the calibrated-trust framework.

# AI Literacy Surveys and Scales

## AI Literacy Instruments

* **SAIL4ALL (Scale of AI Literacy for All)** ‚Äì A comprehensive 56-item questionnaire covering four themes (‚ÄúWhat is AI?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat can AI do?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow does AI work?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow should AI be used?‚Äù). The full SAIL4ALL instrument was developed by Soto-Sanfiel et al. (2024) for general adult populations. **Availability:** The authors have made materials available via OSF (requires login) and in the published article‚Äôs appendix. For example, an **author-provided OSF link** contains the full item set (in true/false or Likert format). Researchers can thus obtain the complete questionnaire from the open-access OSF repository or the paper‚Äôs supplementary files.

* **SNAIL (Scale for Non-Experts‚Äô AI Literacy)** ‚Äì A 39-item self-report scale by Laupichler et al. (2023) to assess laypersons‚Äô AI literacy. **Availability:** The entire item list is published as an appendix in the authors‚Äô work. For instance, Appendix F of an AI Commons summary reproduces all SNAIL survey items (e.g. *‚ÄúI can explain the differences between human and artificial intelligence‚Äù*, *‚ÄúI can name weaknesses of artificial intelligence‚Äù*) categorized by three factors: Technical Understanding, Critical Appraisal, and Practical Application. Because the development papers are available via DOI (open access), the full questionnaire can be obtained from those sources (with all items openly listed in the appendix).

* **AI Literacy Scale (Wang, Rau & Yuan 2022)** ‚Äì A concise 12-item scale measuring four facets of AI literacy: awareness, usage, evaluation, and ethics. **Availability:** The scale was published in *Behavior & Information Technology*. While the article itself is paywalled, **all survey items are provided in its Appendix E**. For example, items include *‚ÄúI can choose the most appropriate AI application or product for a particular task‚Äù* and *‚ÄúI can distinguish between smart devices and non-smart devices.‚Äù*. Researchers can access the full item list by obtaining the article (or via institutional access) and consulting Appendix E, where the instrument is fully documented.

* **AILQ (AI Literacy Questionnaire)** ‚Äì A 32-item instrument assessing secondary students‚Äô AI literacy across affective, behavioral, cognitive, and ethical dimensions. **Availability:** Developed by Ng et al. (2024), the AILQ is described in the *British Journal of Educational Technology*. The published article confirms the four-factor structure and sample items but does not include the full item list in the main text. The complete questionnaire was likely provided in supplementary material or appendices. However, since the BJET article is paywalled, obtaining the precise wording of all 32 items may require access via the publisher or contacting the authors. *Alternative:* A shorter open-access tool exists ‚Äì the **PAILQ-6 (Perceived AI Literacy Questionnaire, 6 items)** ‚Äì which distills key competencies into a few items and is available in an ACM digital library publication. This six-item scale (e.g. *‚ÄúI understand how AI works‚Äù*) can serve as a publicly available proxy if the full AILQ is inaccessible.

* **Other AI Literacy Measures:** Several additional scales have been developed recently (as summarized by Lintner 2024). For example, **AILS (Zhang & Yang 2021)**, another general-population AI literacy survey (12 items), and **GSE-6AI** ‚Äì a brief 6-item general self-efficacy scale adapted for AI contexts. Many of these are available in open-access journals or repositories. For instance, **GSE-6AI** (Morales-Garc√≠a et al., 2022) is published with full English and Spanish items for quick assessment of one‚Äôs confidence in using AI. Researchers should consult the systematic review  for references to each instrument and whether the authors have shared the questionnaires (several are in appendices or supplemental files of their respective articles). In general, most AI literacy scales from 2021‚Äì2023 are in academic papers; if a given scale‚Äôs primary source is paywalled, the described items or an open replication (e.g. translations in other studies) may be found in subsequent open-access studies.

## AI Trust Questionnaires

* **Checklist for Trust Between People and Automation (Jian et al., 1998/2000)** ‚Äì This classic 12-item trust in automation scale is widely cited. It asks users to rate statements about an automated system‚Äôs behavior (originally on a 7-point Likert scale). **Availability:** The full checklist was published in Jian et al.‚Äôs 2000 paper (Int. J. Cognitive Ergonomics). All 12 items are now public; for example, an online scale repository lists the exact statements. Key items include: *‚ÄúThe system is deceptive,‚Äù ‚ÄúI am confident in the system,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe system is reliable,‚Äù ‚ÄúI can trust the system,‚Äù* etc.. Because the original article provides the scale and administration instructions, one can obtain the complete instrument text from that source or via summaries on sites like GMU‚Äôs HRI Scale Database (which openly presents the final scale items). In sum, the Jian et al. trust scale is **fully available** in the literature and freely quoted in many subsequent works.

* **TOAST (Trust of Automated Systems Test)** ‚Äì A newer, short survey (9 items) developed by Wojton et al. (2020) to quickly gauge user trust in an AI/automated system‚Äôs performance and the user‚Äôs understanding. **Availability:** The TOAST instrument is openly described in the *Journal of Social Psychology* and summarized on the TestScience.org website. The **full list of 9 Likert-scale items** is available as an image on TestScience (see the screenshot under ‚ÄúSurvey‚Äù) ‚Äì for example: *‚ÄúI understand what the system should do.‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe system performs consistently.‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel comfortable relying on the information provided by the system.‚Äù*. The site also provides scoring guidelines. Because TOAST is under active validation, the authors have shared its content; researchers can directly use the published items (available via the open-access summary or the image above).

* **Human-Computer Trust Questionnaire (Madsen & Gregor, 2000)** ‚Äì A multi-dimensional trust survey focusing on user trust in an AI or decision aid‚Äôs capabilities and purpose. **Availability:** Originally presented at an academic conference, this questionnaire‚Äôs items were embedded in the conference proceedings. While not as widely reprinted as Jian‚Äôs scale, the **full instrument can be found in the authors‚Äô paper** (which may be accessed through academic libraries or author-posted PDFs). Notably, Madsen & Gregor‚Äôs instrument includes subscales like *Understandability* and *Reliability* of the system. For instance, items probed whether users felt they understood the system‚Äôs processes or whether the system met their expectations. If the official source is behind a paywall, interested readers might locate the items in secondary sources that cite the questionnaire (some later studies summarize or adapt its items).

* **Trust in AI Systems (TAI) and Domain-Specific Scales** ‚Äì In recent years, researchers have created trust surveys tailored to AI in specific contexts (e.g. healthcare). For example, one ‚ÄúTrust in AI‚Äù (TAI) scale builds on existing trust scales to address AI-driven decisions. Similarly, a **clinician trust in medical AI** instrument was developed in 2022 to assess doctors‚Äô trust in diagnostic AI tools. **Availability:** These specialized scales are often described in journal articles. If the article is paywalled, check for supplementary materials or preprints (many authors post preprints on arXiv or ResearchGate). For instance, a recent arXiv paper by Chauhan et al. validates a TAI questionnaire and may include sample items or a link to the full survey. In general, **trust scales tend to be published in full** because validation requires item disclosure; thus, by reviewing the methodology sections or appendices of these papers, one can usually retrieve the complete set of questions.

* **Additional Resources:** NIST‚Äôs report *‚ÄúMeasuring Trust in AI‚Äù* (2022) is not a survey per se but provides a **framework of trust factors** and example items, which can guide questionnaire development. The OECD.AI Policy Observatory also lists instruments like the **Human-Computer Trust Scale (HCTS)** and **Human-Robot Interaction Trust Scale (HRITS)** with basic info (e.g. HCTS is a simple 9-item Likert scale) ‚Äì the actual questionnaires correspond to published research (Lee & Moray, 1994 for HRI trust, etc.) and may be obtained from those original publications. In summary, many AI trust instruments are openly accessible either through their original academic sources or via summary databases; where a scale is behind a paywall, looking for an author‚Äôs university repository or a cited secondary source often yields a publicly available version.

## Automation Bias and Complacency Measures

* **Complacency-Potential Rating Scale (CPRS)** ‚Äì A 20-item survey by Singh, Molloy & Parasuraman (1993) that gauges a person‚Äôs tendency to over-rely on automation. This scale captures ‚Äúautomation bias‚Äù as an attitude: overconfidence in and overuse of automated systems. **Availability:** The CPRS was published in an older journal and is not widely posted online, but its content is documented in literature. A review paper notes that CPRS items are rated on a 5-point scale and factor analysis revealed subcomponents like *trust, reliance,* and *confidence* in automation. While the **exact item texts** are not all listed in that review, one example item given is: *‚ÄúPeople save time by using automatic teller machines (ATMs) rather than a bank teller for banking transactions.‚Äù*. The original publication (and a 1993 technical report) contain the full item list; those sources are behind paywalls, but interested users can request the article via libraries or contact the authors. **Alternative:** In 2019, Merritt et al. developed a **new Complacency Potential scale** with 10 updated items (two subscales: ‚ÄúAlleviating Workload‚Äù and ‚ÄúMonitoring‚Äù). This updated scale was published open-access in *Frontiers in Psychology*, and the paper includes the new items or at least describes them thoroughly. Thus, researchers seeking a publicly available measure of automation bias can use Merritt‚Äôs 10-item scale (available in the open-access article) as a modern alternative to the original CPRS.

* **Automation Trust vs. Automation Bias Metrics:** It‚Äôs important to note that automation bias is often measured through **performance outcomes** (errors of omission/commission when using automation) rather than self-report. There is no single standardized ‚Äúautomation bias questionnaire‚Äù beyond assessing trust/complacency. Instead, researchers use instruments like the CPRS (above) or **propensity to trust automation scales** to infer bias. For example, **Merritt‚Äôs Propensity to Trust Automation Scale (2013)** is a self-report measure (published in open literature) that can indicate a user‚Äôs general tendency to trust or distrust automated systems, which correlates with bias. **Availability:** Merritt‚Äôs scale was published with its items (it‚Äôs a 12-item scale similar to Jian‚Äôs but framed as trait-based). Those items are available in her dissertation and subsequent papers (often open access). Similarly, **custom questionnaires** in human factors studies sometimes include a few Likert items to directly probe automation bias (e.g. ‚ÄúI relied on the automation even when I felt I shouldn‚Äôt have‚Äù). Such items, if not in a validated scale, are usually reported in the method section of the study. In summary, for **automation bias**, one should look to scales of over-reliance like CPRS or trust propensity (many of which are published in full in archival journals) and to experimental task data. The CPRS (attitude survey) is embedded in its original articles (paywalled), but an updated open-access version now exists; no separate ‚Äúbias index survey‚Äù needs to be purchased or licensed.

* **Task-Specific Automation Bias Tools:** Some studies include questionnaires after simulation exercises to capture bias in decision-making. For instance, Skitka et al. (2000) had participants use an automated aide and then answer questions about their reliance on it. These were study-specific and are described in those articles (e.g., items asking if they double-checked the computer‚Äôs recommendations). **Availability:** These are not standardized instruments, but if the user‚Äôs provided list included any such study (e.g., an *‚Äúautomation bias post-questionnaire‚Äù*), one should consult that study‚Äôs appendix. Often, the *appendix of experimental papers* will list the debrief survey or items assessing trust and reliance after using the system. If paywalled, try to find if the authors have an open technical report or conference version. For example, **Mosier et al. (1998)** presented a set of questions to pilots after an automated system flight simulation; those questions (though not a formal named scale) are likely quoted in the conference proceedings (which might be accessible via ResearchGate). In summary, **many automation-bias-related questionnaires are embedded in research papers**; they may not be standalone named instruments but are usually described enough that readers can extract the items.

## AI Use and Confidence Surveys

* **AI Self-Efficacy and Confidence Scales:** A common way to measure individuals‚Äô confidence in using AI is via self-efficacy instruments. One example is the **AI Self-Efficacy Scale (AISES)** by Wang & Chuang (2023), which assesses general population confidence in understanding and applying AI. **Availability:** The AISES (4-factor, \~20 items) is described in a recent journal article (with high structural validity). The full item set is likely given in that paper‚Äôs appendix or tables (the authors note it‚Äôs in English). Another very brief tool is **GSE-6AI**, a 6-item general self-efficacy scale adapted to AI contexts. Morales-Garc√≠a et al. (2022) published GSE-6AI with each item (in Spanish and English) in open-access format. For example, an item is *‚ÄúI feel confident that I can learn to use any AI system if I put in the effort.‚Äù* (paraphrased). Since GSE-6AI is openly available (it‚Äôs mentioned in a Frontiers paper on AI literacy), practitioners looking to gauge AI-use confidence can freely adopt it. In summary, these self-efficacy surveys are **available in the public domain via their publications**. If the primary source is inaccessible, the Lintner (2024) review  succinctly describes them and can be cited as a secondary source for the scale items.

* **AI Adoption and Usage Questionnaires:** Beyond self-efficacy, some surveys ask about **frequency of AI tool use, perceived helpfulness, and comfort**. These are often custom-designed for specific studies or programs. For instance, Western Governors University Labs conducted a survey of students‚Äô AI tool use; students were asked how often they use AI for coursework and how confident they feel doing so. Early findings (2023) showed increases in both AI use and confidence over time. **Availability:** Such surveys are typically project-specific and not published in academic journals. However, the **questionnaires themselves may be shared in reports or blogs**. In the WGU example, a summary report (on the organization‚Äôs website) indicates the measured constructs (usage, confidence, perceived usefulness), but the full question wording might not be publicly posted. If the user‚Äôs list refers to an ‚ÄúAI Use/Confidence Survey‚Äù from a particular study, the best approach is to check that study‚Äôs supplementary info or appendices. Frequently, academic studies include sample survey questions in the method section. For a **formal instrument**, one emerging option is the **AI Attitude Scale (AIAS)** ‚Äì a short scale measuring attitudes including confidence in using AI. Ahmad et al. (2023) propose a 4-item AIAS in *Frontiers*. Being open-access, it provides its items (covering positive orientation toward AI, which correlates with one‚Äôs confidence to use it). Another is **ATTARI-12** (Attitudes Toward AI, 12 items) which treats comfort with AI as a single construct; it‚Äôs published open-access in *Nature Scientific Reports* and includes all 12 statements (ranging from enthusiasm to anxiety ‚Äì the absence of anxiety can be read as confidence). **Summary:** If a dedicated ‚ÄúAI confidence‚Äù instrument is needed, researchers can freely use an adaptation of tech self-efficacy scales (like GSE-6AI above) or attitude scales from open sources. When a survey is only described in a paywalled source, look for any companion papers or OSF datasets ‚Äì authors sometimes deposit the survey in an online repository even if the paper is closed access.

* **Teacher and Student AI Readiness Surveys:** In education contexts, surveys often combine AI **usage frequency, confidence, and readiness**. For example, Teo et al. (2022) measured teachers‚Äô *‚Äúconfidence in teaching with AI‚Äù* and *‚Äúreadiness for AI‚Äù* as part of a larger questionnaire. Such instruments usually appear in conference proceedings or journals (e.g., a BMC Psychology article on university teachers‚Äô AI readiness). **Availability:** Many of these are open-access. One arXiv preprint provides a full survey used in a pre-tertiary AI curriculum evaluation, with subscales for *AI knowledge, AI readiness, AI confidence, AI relevance,* etc. and item counts for each. It explicitly defines *AI Confidence (AICF)* as a 5-item scale (sample item: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm certain that I can succeed in an AI class if I work hard enough‚Äù*). Because this preprint includes an appendix with all survey items, it‚Äôs a great **public alternative** for an AI confidence measure. In summary, educators and researchers can access these kinds of instruments through open educational research publications. If the specific survey on the list is not openly published, one can likely find a closely related one (with similar constructs) that is freely available as a substitute.

## Energy Literacy and Appliance Knowledge Surveys

* **DeWaters & Powers Energy Literacy Questionnaire (2011‚Äì2013)** ‚Äì A comprehensive survey assessing middle/high school students‚Äô knowledge of energy concepts, attitudes about energy use, and energy-related behaviors. **Availability:** The instrument was developed as part of Jan DeWaters‚Äô thesis and several papers. In *Journal of Environmental Education (2013)*, DeWaters & Powers describe establishing criteria for the questionnaire. The full set of items covers factual knowledge (e.g. understanding of electricity, renewable vs. nonrenewable resources), as well as Likert attitude statements about conservation. **Access conditions:** The 2013 JEE article is paywalled, and while it thoroughly discusses the domains and sample items, it does not print all items in the text. However, **related open sources exist:** DeWaters and colleagues presented the questionnaire content in conference papers and a 2011 Energy Policy article (which may be accessible via institutional repositories). Additionally, a **National Science Foundation report** or **Digital Commons thesis** might contain the entire question list. For example, a 2011 conference paper by DeWaters et al. included an appendix with the question bank. If the full survey is needed openly, one strategy is to search for ‚ÄúEnergy Literacy Questionnaire DeWaters supplemental‚Äù ‚Äì in some cases, scholars have uploaded the survey to ResearchGate or ERIC. Indeed, an ERIC document notes that the New York State energy literacy survey included various item types (multiple-choice, true/false, short answer) aligned to knowledge, affect, and behavior categories. In summary, the **original Energy Literacy Questionnaire** can be obtained by requesting the 2011/2013 papers from the authors or finding the instruments in dissertations ‚Äì it was not a commercial instrument, so authors have shared it upon request.

* **NEF National Energy Literacy Survey (2022)** ‚Äì A recent survey administered by the National Energy Foundation to U.S. high school seniors and recent graduates. It assesses knowledge of energy topics and personal opinions/behaviors. **Availability:** **Fully public.** The NEF has published the **entire questionnaire** (Wave 2, 2022) as a PDF on their website. This 22-page instrument includes demographic questions, multiple-choice knowledge questions, and attitude questions. For example, it asks *‚ÄúWhich of the following resources creates the fewest emissions when used to generate electricity?‚Äù* (with multiple-choice options), *‚ÄúWhich of the following uses the most energy in the average American home annually?‚Äù*, and *‚ÄúWhich of the following is a renewable energy resource?‚Äù*. It also has behavioral items like how often students perform energy-saving actions. Because the **entire survey is published in that PDF** (including all question wording and answer choices), researchers or educators can directly use it or adapt it. The only note is that it‚Äôs a copyrighted NEF document, but it‚Äôs freely accessible for review and educational use (non-commercial). The NEF survey is an excellent openly available instrument that mirrors many questions from the academic DeWaters\&Powers survey but in updated form and with national data.

* **Public Perception of Energy Consumption (Attari et al., 2010)** ‚Äì This study is not a traditional quiz but reveals gaps in appliance energy knowledge. Participants were asked to estimate the energy use (or savings) of various household activities and appliances. For instance, they estimated how much energy a lightbulb uses vs. a dishwasher, and named the single most effective strategy they could implement to save energy. **Availability:** The core survey instrument (the list of 15 household activities and their actual energy values) is available in the **PNAS article‚Äôs Supporting Information**. Attari et al. provided tables of actual vs. perceived energy use in the SI PDF. The SI (which is open-access on the PNAS website) includes the questions prompts. Specifically, it lists all activities respondents rated ‚Äì for example, *‚ÄúEstimate the energy used by: (a) a ceiling fan left on for 12 hours, (b) an HVAC system running for 1 hour,‚Äù* etc., along with how participants‚Äô estimates were collected. Because PNAS makes Supporting Information freely downloadable, anyone can obtain these materials. Thus, while this is more of a research task list than a standard questionnaire, it **is publicly accessible**. If one wanted to replicate an ‚Äúappliance knowledge‚Äù quiz, they could use Attari‚Äôs list of items (from the SI) as a ready-made set of questions about which device uses more energy, etc.

* **Energy Literacy Scale (ELS, 2022)** ‚Äì Chen et al. (2022) developed an Energy Literacy Scale for secondary students in Taiwan (covering knowledge, attitudes, and behavior). **Availability:** Published in *Environmental Science & Engineering* (and on ResearchGate), the ELS instrument (like DeWaters‚Äô) spans cognitive items (e.g. understanding CO<sub>2</sub> emissions), affective items (interest in saving energy), and behavioral items. The authors provide a sample contextualized unit in their paper illustrating the question style. However, the **full item set** might not be in the main text. Supplementary materials or the appendix of that paper (if any) would contain the exact questions. Since the journal may be paywalled, Chen et al. also shared data via ERIC, which suggests that some form of the instrument is accessible. Researchers can likely email the authors for the full ELS survey; being an academic instrument, it‚Äôs intended for public research use.

* **Appliance Knowledge Quizzes and Miscellaneous:** There are various publicly available quizzes that test appliance energy knowledge. For instance, the U.S. Department of Energy and EPA have released short quizzes (e.g., *‚ÄúTest Your Energy IQ‚Äù* with questions like *‚ÄúWhat household appliance uses the most energy annually?‚Äù*). While not formal research instruments, these can be freely accessed on .gov websites. If the list provided refers to an ‚ÄúAppliance knowledge survey,‚Äù it could mean a subset of questions like those in the NEF or Attari studies. **Availability:** Government and educational websites often host PDFs or web pages with such questions for outreach ‚Äì these are completely open to use. As an example, the **ENERGY STAR program** once published a Home Energy Quiz with Q\&A explaining common misconceptions (this can often be found via an internet archive or current DOE site).

**In summary**, for each instrument above, the **original or official source** is the best starting point ‚Äì many are open-access articles or reports. Where an instrument is **paywalled**, there is usually a path to a **similar open-access instrument or a supplementary file**. We organized the sources by category to aid quick reference. Researchers and practitioners should be able to obtain the full text of these surveys either through the linked open materials or by leveraging the noted alternatives:

* *AI Literacy:* Most scales are in academic literature (many open access). Check appendices of those papers or the OSF links provided by authors.
* *AI Trust:* Several foundational scales (Jian et al., TOAST) are fully public. Others can be found in free repositories or author preprints.
* *Automation Bias:* The CPRS is in older literature but an updated open scale exists. Key references give example items.
* *AI Use/Confidence:* Look for self-efficacy scales (many open) and education surveys (often open or in dissertations).
* *Energy Literacy:* Older student surveys (DeWaters) are described in papers (request if needed), whereas newer ones like NEF are fully published online.

Each bullet above includes either a direct link or a citation to where the **full instrument or item set can be accessed**. By following those links or notes, you can obtain the complete surveys and any scoring guides provided alongside them.



**Organizing survey items**

The user wants a Pandoc markdown table that categories survey items and specifies their availability. I'll organize the table by categories like AI Literacy, Trust, Automation Bias, etc., and include for each instrument: its name, category, availability type (e.g., open access, paywalled), and a link (either original or on OSF).

I‚Äôll ensure the response is clear and well-structured while properly categorizing all the survey instruments as the user asks.

**Gathering sources and building table**

I need to create a table with columns for Instrument, Category, Availability, Access Details, and Source, referencing web results. I shouldn‚Äôt include raw URLs, instead using citations for sources. I'll gather information by searching for each survey instrument, like SAIL4ALL, SNAIL, and others, quickly accessing references. This should give me a good amount of details to compile the table, though it may be more generalized given time constraints. I‚Äôll rely on reference information and organize accordingly.


**Compiling survey table**

I‚Äôll create a table as requested with columns for Category, Instrument, # Items, Availability, Access Note, and Source (citation). The table will merge the Availability and Access Note columns for clarity, saying something like ‚ÄúOSF repository (see source)‚Äù instead of raw URLs. I‚Äôve already gathered information for instruments like SAIL4ALL and SNAIL, with available details such as item count, availability status, and access notes. Citations will match sources from websites or other resources. I‚Äôll keep it compact and readable for the user.

**Summarizing survey details**

For each survey, I'll list the instrument name, number of items, and availability. Some surveys, like the AILQ, are paywalled but may have items in the supplement; others like the GSE-6AI are open access. Surveys such as Jian Trust in Automation and TOAST are freely accessible, while others might be paywalled or require contact for access. I‚Äôll clarify the availability and reference sources where possible. Thank goodness I have space to fit the details for each survey!


**Finalizing survey details**

I‚Äôll finalize the details for the surveys to include in the table. AILQ is paywalled but may have items in the supplement. GSE-6AI is open access, available through Frontiers, and has a full list of items. The Jian Trust in Automation checklist and TOAST are freely accessible. Some instruments may require quick searches for additional data, like Madsen & Gregor. I'll include the most relevant and accurate references for each. Time to set it all up!


Thought for 37 seconds


Below is a **pandoc-markdown table** that groups each instrument by *content domain* and summarizes its item count, public availability, and the most direct official access route.  I omit live URLs (per platform policy); instead, follow the citation IDs to the referenced sources or search the instrument title at the noted repository (e.g., OSF, ResearchGate, publisher site).
