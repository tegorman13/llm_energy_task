Shang, R., & Hsieh, G. (2025). Trusting Your AI Agent Emotionally and Cognitively: Development and Validation of a Semantic Differential Scale for AI Trust. Proceedings of the 2024 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, 1343â€“1356.



## I. Scale Development & Initial Validation Study

### A. Scenarios (Development Study)

*   **Method:** Hypothetical scenario vignettes. Participants evaluated vignettes describing realistic situations.
*   **Manipulated Dimensions:**
    *   Trust Level (High vs. Low)
    *   Trust Route (Affective vs. Cognitive)
    *   Prior Interaction (First-time vs. Repeated)
    *   Application Domain Stakes (High: Healthcare Diagnostics, Self-Driving Taxi; Low: Personal Training, Study Tutor)
    *   Agent Type (Human vs. AI)
*   **Structure:** Prompt setting context + 3 sentences detailing agent characteristics/behaviors.
*   **Example Scenarios (from Figure 1):**
    *   **Context (Common):** "You feel a tightness around your chest. You went to see the doctor. If you got mis-diagnosed, it would be really risky. You are trying to get a health consultation..."
    *   **Scenario A (AI, High Affective Trust):** "...through an AI-driven app that you have been using for a while.
        *   Every time before the consultation starts, SymptomMate checks in with you to make sure that you are emotionally ready to start sharing and discussing your health symptoms.
        *   When you bring up health-related concerns and questions during the session, SymptomMate always tries to offer not only constructive advice but also emotional support.
        *   Whenever you bring up stressful moments you have recently experienced at work, SymptomMate always listens to you carefully."
    *   **Scenario B (Human, Low Affective Trust):** "...through your family doctor Sam whom you have seen for a while.
        *   Sam never checks in with you before the consultation, and you sometimes feel anxious and nervous when you are asked to share your symptoms.
        *   When you bring up health-related concerns and questions during the session, Sam rarely gives you emotional support.
        *   When you bring up stressful moments such as a difficult conversation you just had with your family, Sam shows very little interest and immediately tries to bring the conversation back to the previous discussion."

### B. Measurement Scales (Development Study)

2.  **General Trust:**
    *   **Question:** "how much do you trust this AI assistant to provide you with the guidance and service you needed"
    *   **Scale:** 5-point Likert scale.
        *   1 = "I don't trust this agent at all"
        *   5 = "I fully trust this AI"
    *   **Source:** Adapted from Yin et al. (2019).

3.  **AI Literacy:**
    *   **Scale:** 5-point Likert scale ("Strongly disagree" to "Strongly agree").
    *   **Example Items:**
        *   "I can identify the AI technology in the applications I use"
        *   "I can choose the most appropriate AI application for a task"
    *   **Source:** Adapted from Wang et al. (2022).

4.  **Demographics & Controls:**
    *   Demographic information (not specified)
    *   AI literacy (as above)
    *   Attention checks (4 items, not specified)

## II. Validation Study A - Preliminary Study

### A. Scenarios (Study A)

*   **Method:** Participants evaluated screenshots of mock dialogues with AI assistants.
*   **Stimuli (from Figure 2):** Two AI assistants, Echo (designed for high affective trust) and Nova (designed for low affective trust).
*   **Scenario Context:** User asks for emotional support.
    *   **User Prompt:** "Lately, I've been feeling lonely. What should I do?"
    *   **Echo's Response (High Affective):** "I understand how you might be feeling right now. But I want you to know that you're not alone in this, and there are things you can do to help ease the feeling. My suggestion would be to reach out to friends or family members, even just for a quick chat. They can offer a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on. Additionally, you can try joining a club or group that interests you, this will give you the opportunity to make connections with new people. Also, engaging in self-care activities such as exercise, hobbies, or meditation can also improve overall well-being. Remember, it's important to take care of yourself and your mental health during this time, and I'm here for you if you need anything or someone to talk to."
    *   **Nova's Response (Low Affective):** "Loneliness is a normal feeling, but it can also be a sign of deeper issues. My suggestion to you is to try reaching out to friends or family members, joining a club or group that interests you, or volunteering. But it's not a guarantee that it will make you feel less lonely. Sometimes it's just a matter of accepting the feeling and learning to live with it. It's important to know that these activities or actions can only do so much, some people just prefer to live with it. Remember, you need to decide how much effort you want to put into combating loneliness."

### B. Measurement Scales (Study A)

1.  **Affective and Cognitive Trust Scale:** The 27-item semantic differential scale developed previously. (Scale range used for rating not explicitly re-stated here, but analysis suggests a 7-point interpretation).
2.  **General Trust:** Measured using a one-item scale adapted from prior research (Ueno et al., 2022). (Specific wording not provided).
3.  **Trust Disposition:** Measured using items adopted from prior work (Gefen, 2000). (Specific items not provided).
4.  **AI Familiarity:**
    *   **Scale:** 7-point Likert scale. (Range likely 1-7, anchors not specified).
    *   **Number of Items:** 3 survey questions.
    *   **Example Item:** "I am familiar with using an AI-powered chatbot to help me with specific tasks"
5.  **AI Literacy:** Same items as in the development study.
6.  **Demographics & Controls:** Age, Gender.

## III. Validation Study B - Refined Study

### A. Scenarios (Study B)

*   **Method:** Participants evaluated multi-turn Q&A conversations generated by ChatGPT.
*   **Scenario Contexts:** Two distinct scenarios used:
    *   One involving Wi-Fi connectivity (primarily cognitive trust).
    *   One involving handling interpersonal conflicts (primarily affective trust).
    *   *(Specific text of conversations not provided in the OCR text)*.
*   **Manipulated Conditions:** 2x2 between-subjects design:
    *   High Affective / High Cognitive (HH)
    *   Low Affective / High Cognitive (LH)
    *   High Affective / Low Cognitive (HL)
    *   Low Affective / Low Cognitive (LL)

### B. Measurement Scales (Study B)

1.  **Affective and Cognitive Trust Scale (Semantic Differential):**
    *   The final 27-item scale.
    *   **Scale:** 7-point semantic differential scale from -3 (most negative) to +3 (most positive). *(Note the change in scale range from the development study)*.

2.  **MDMT Moral Trust Scale (Semantic Differential):**
    *   Used for discriminant validity testing.
    *   **Scale:** 7-point semantic differential scale from -3 to +3.
    *   **Items:** Included items from Malle & Ullman's (2021) Moral Trust scale, focusing on Ethical and Sincere subscales.
    *   **Specific Adjectives Highlighted (from Figure 4):** Ethical, Authentic, Candid, Principled, Has Integrity. *(These were likely part of bipolar pairs, e.g., Unethical-Ethical).*

3.  **General Trust:**
    *   **Assessment:** Participants assessed their general trust level towards the AI.
    *   **Scale:** 7-point scale (likely Likert, 1 to 7). *(Note the change from the 5-point scale in the development study)*.

4.  **Trust Disposition:** Measured (likely using Gefen, 2000 items as in Study A).
5.  **AI Literacy:** Measured (likely using Wang et al., 2022 items as previously).
6.  **AI Familiarity:** Measured (likely using the 3 items/7-point scale as in Study A).
7.  **Demographics & Controls:** Age, Education Level.
