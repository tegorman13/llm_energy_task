## Welcome and Introduction

Hello and welcome!

We thank you for your interest and willingness to participate in this online study. This research is executed in the chair of **Social Psychology: Media and Communication**, headed by Prof. Dr. Nicole Krämer. This study is executed within the framework of a cooperation of the University of Duisburg-Essen, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund and University Hospital Essen.

In this study we want to investigate the **influence of different human factors on the reception of advice given by Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. You will be asked to run through a skin lesion classification task within which you will be aided by an AI. Afterwards you have to complete different questionnaires concerning various personality factors.

The survey will approximately take **12 minutes**.

Participation in the study is **voluntary**. You can terminate the study at any time and without giving reasons. There are no negative consequences if you terminate participation compared to the study.

## Lesion Classification Task Instructions

In the following you will be presented with **24 classification tasks of lesion images**. You will see a clinical photography of a skin lesion and will be asked to decide whether you would **classify the lesion as benign or malign** on a scale from **0% (definitely benign) to 100% (definitely malign)**.

After indicating your estimation and pressing the "Next" button you will be presented with the same image. However, now you will be shown **additional advice on diagnosis given by an AI**. Please consider this advice to form a **second opinion** and help you assess your first estimation. The AI was previously trained on a dataset provided by University Skin Cancer Center Tübingen, it reached an accuracy of **about 80%**. A human expert with similar support can make **mistakes** in this classification. We are aiming for a high total accuracy through the **collaboration of human and AI**.

If you want to you can adjust your prior estimate. After pressing "Next" again you will be presented with the next lesion image.

*(Note: The actual task involved presenting 24 images, asking for an initial slider rating (0-100), then showing the AI's slider rating (reported as 80% accurate overall), and allowing the participant to provide a final slider rating. The screenshot shows an example mid-task.)*

## Post-Task Questionnaires

### 6. AI System Trust (Post-Task Evaluation)

After interacting with the AI system presenting its classification in the previous tasks, please read the following sentences carefully and indicate how you would rate the AI system.
Please indicate the degree to which you agree/disagree with the following statements.

**(Scale: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree)**

*   The system is designed to be trustworthy.
    *   ( ) strongly disagree ( ) disagree ( ) neutral ( ) agree ( ) strongly agree
*   I distrust the system.
    *   ( ) strongly disagree ( ) disagree ( ) neutral ( ) agree ( ) strongly agree
*   I trust the system.
    *   ( ) strongly disagree ( ) disagree ( ) neutral ( ) agree ( ) strongly agree
*   I lack faith in the system.
    *   ( ) strongly disagree ( ) disagree ( ) neutral ( ) agree ( ) strongly agree
*   I believe in the system.
    *   ( ) strongly disagree ( ) disagree ( ) neutral ( ) agree ( ) strongly agree

*(Note: The paper identifies this as the Global Trust Scale by Wischnewski et al., 2008 [Ref 68 in paper])*

### 7. General Technology Interaction (Affinity)

In the following questionnaire, we will ask you about your interaction with entire digital devices. The term **technical system** refers to apps and other software applications, as well as entire digital devices (e.g. mobile phone, computer, TV, car navigation).
Please indicate the degree to which you agree/disagree with the following statements.

**(Scale: 1 = completely disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = agree, 6 = completely agree)**

*   It is predominantly deal with technical systems because I have to.
    *   ( ) completely disagree (...) ( ) completely agree
*   I enjoy spending time becoming acquainted with a new technical system.
    *   ( ) completely disagree (...) ( ) completely agree
*   I try to make full use of the capabilities of a technical system.
    *   ( ) completely disagree (...) ( ) completely agree
*   It is enough for me that a technical system works: I don't care how or why.
    *   ( ) completely disagree (...) ( ) completely agree
*   I like testing the functions of new technical systems.
    *   ( ) completely disagree (...) ( ) completely agree
*   I try to understand how a technical system exactly works.
    *   ( ) completely disagree (...) ( ) completely agree
*   I like to occupy myself in greater detail with technical systems.
    *   ( ) completely disagree (...) ( ) completely agree
*   When I have a new technical system in front of me, I try it out intensively.
    *   ( ) completely disagree (...) ( ) completely agree

*(Note: The paper identifies this as the Affinity for Technology Interaction (ATI) Scale by Franke et al., 2019 [Ref 61 in paper], although it mentions 9 items while the screenshot shows 8. There might be a slight discrepancy or one item is off-screen/omitted in the final version shown).*

### Other Questionnaires (Described in Paper, Not Shown in Screenshot)

The study methods section also describes the use of the following questionnaires, which were presumably presented after the ones shown:

*   **Propensity to Trust Technology:** 6-item questionnaire by Jessup et al. (2019) [Ref 69], 5-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Example item: "Technology is reliable."
*   **Control Beliefs in Dealing with Technology:** 8-item German "Kontrollüberzeugung im Umgang mit Technik" questionnaire by Beier (1999) [Ref 62], translated to English, 5-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Example item: "Even if I encounter resistance, I continue to work on technical problems."
*   **Need for Cognition:** Short 6-item scale by Lins de Holanda Coelho et al. (2020) [Ref 64], 5-point scale (extremely uncharacteristic of me to extremely characteristic of me). Example item: "I would prefer complex to simple problems".
