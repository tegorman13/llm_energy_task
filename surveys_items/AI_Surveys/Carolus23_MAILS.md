In the following, you will read descriptions of different abilities that one can have when dealing with artificial intelligence. These abilities can be more or less pronounced. Please rate yourself: How pronounced are your abilities?

A value of **0** means that an ability is not at all or hardly pronounced.
A value of **10** means that an ability is very well or (almost) perfectly pronounced.

*Instructions state to circle the value that best describes your ability on a 0-10 scale for each item below.*

## Scale Structure and Scoring

The Meta-Artificial Intelligence Literacy Scale is divided into the following sections. To determine the individual values, a mean score must be calculated from the corresponding items.

**Artificial Intelligence Literacy**
- **Use & Apply:** Items 1 to 6
- **Know & Understand:** Items 7 to 12
- **Detect Al:** Items 13 to 15
- **Al Ethics:** Items 16 to 18

**Create Al**
- Items 19 to 22

**Al Self-Efficacy**
- **Al Problem-Solving:** Items 23 to 25
- **Learning:** Items 26 to 28

**Al Self-Competency**
- **Persuasion Literacy:** Items 29 to 31
- **Emotion Regulation:** Items 32 to 34
