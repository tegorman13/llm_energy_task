## Student Perception of ChatGPT

Dear Student,

The Faculty of Public Administration, University of Ljubljana (from Slovenia, Europe), together with over 200 international academic partners, is conducting a global student survey entitled **Students Perception of ChatGPT**.

The recent exponential growth in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has led us to recognize the importance of understanding how ChatGPT shapes higher education students experiences and learning outcomes by specifically analysing how students with diverse cultural backgrounds view ChatGPT.

Students attending higher education institutions around the world are kindly invited to complete the questionnaire to help us understand your perception and use of ChatGPT. Participation in the study is completely voluntary. It should take about 15 minutes to complete the questionnaire, divided into **11 sections**. All answers are treated as **anonymous**. The data collected will only be used for research purposes and only be disseminated in aggregate form.
