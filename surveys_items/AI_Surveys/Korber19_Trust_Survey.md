**Instructions:** Please indicate your agreement with the following statements regarding the automated system.

**Response Scale:**
1 = Strongly disagree
2 = Disagree
3 = Neither agree nor disagree
4 = Agree
5 = Strongly agree

## Items

### Subscale: Reliability/Competence

1.  (R/C1) The system is capable of interpreting situations correctly
6.  (R/C2) The system works reliably
10. (R/C3*) A system malfunction is likely _(Inverse Item)_
13. (R/C4) The system is capable of taking over complicated tasks
15. (R/C5*) The system might make sporadic errors _(Inverse Item)_
19. (R/C6) I am confident about the system's capabilities

### Subscale: Understanding/Predictability

2.  (U/P1) The system state was always clear to me
7.  (U/P2*) The system reacts unpredictably _(Inverse Item)_
11. (U/P3) I was able to understand why things happened
16. (U/P4*) It's difficult to identify what the system will do next _(Inverse Item)_

### Subscale: Familiarity

3.  (F1) I already know similar systems
17. (F2) I have already used similar systems

### Subscale: Intention of Developers

4.  (I1) The developers are trustworthy
8.  (I2) The developers take my well-being seriously

### Subscale: Propensity to Trust

5.  (Pro1*) One should be careful with unfamiliar automated systems _(Inverse Item)_
12. (Pro2) I rather trust a system than I mistrust it
18. (Pro3) Automated systems generally work well

### Subscale: Trust in Automation

9.  (T1) I trust the system
14. (T2) I can rely on the system

**Note on Scoring:** Items marked with (*) and `_(Inverse Item)_` are inverse coded. Before calculating subscale scores (typically by averaging the items within a subscale), these items need to be recoded. For a 5-point scale, the recoding is: 1 becomes 5, 2 becomes 4, 3 remains 3, 4 becomes 2, and 5 becomes 1.
