### Checklist for Trust between People and Automation

Below is a list of statement for evaluating trust between people and automation. There are several scales for you to rate intensity of your feeling of trust, or your impression of the system while operating a machine. Please mark an “x” on each line at the point which best describes your feeling or your impression. ¹⁰

(Note: not at all=1; extremely=7)

1.  The system is deceptive
    (Scale: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

2.  The system behaves in an underhanded manner
    (Scale: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

3.  I am suspicious of the system’s intent, action, or outputs
    (Scale: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

4.  I am wary of the system
    (Scale: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

## Appendix B – Complacency-Potential Rating Scale (Singh, Molloy, & Parasuraman, 1993)

**(Source: Page 128-129)**

### Instructions

Read each statement carefully and check one response out of five alternatives in the appropriate box which you feel accurately described your views or experiences. The responses vary on a scale of agreement / disagreement, from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree:. For example:

**Statement:**
Doing research in a library has been made easier by the introduction of computerized card cataloguing systems.

[ ] Strongly agree [ ] Agree [ ] Undecided [ ] Disagree [ ] Strongly disagree

Give your answer for each statement and be sure to place your response in the correct place. Remember, this is an opinion survey and not a test of intelligence or ability. There are no right or wrong answers, only answer that fit your views accurately. Do not skip any question. Time is limited. Do you have any questions?

*(Rating Scale: Strongly agree, Agree, Undecided, Disagree, Strongly disagree)*

### Statements

1.  Manually sorting through card catalogues is more reliable than computer-aided searches for finding items in a library.
2.  If I need to have a tumour in my body removed, I would choose to undergo computer-aided surgery using laser technology because computerized surgery is more reliable and safer than manual surgery.
3.  People save time by using automatic teller machines (ATMs) rather than a bank teller for banking transactions.
4.  I do not trust automated devices such as ATMs and computerized airline reservation systems.
5.  People who work frequently with automated devices have lower job satisfaction because they feel less involved in their job than those who work manually.
6.  I feel safer depositing my money at ATM than with a human teller.
7.  I have to tape an important TV program for a class assignment. To ensure that the correct program is recorded, I would use the automatic programming facility on my VCR rather than manually taping.
8.  People whose job requires them to work with automated systems are lonelier than people who do not have work with such devices.
9.  Automated systems used in modern aircraft, such as the automatic landing system, have made air journeys safer.
10. ATMs provide a safeguard against the inappropriate use of an individual’s bank account by dishonest people.
11. Automated devices used in aviation and banking have made work easier for both employees and customers.
12. I often use automated devices.
13. People who work with automated devices have greater job satisfaction because they feel more involved than those who work manually.
14. Automated devices in medicine save time and money in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.
15. Even though the automatic cruise control in my car is set at a speed below the speed limit, I worry when I pass a police radar speed-trap in case the automatic control is not working properly.
16. Bank transactions have become safer with the introduction of computer technology for the transfer of funds.
17. I would rather purchase an item using a computer than have to deal with a sale representative on the phone because my order is more likely to be correct using the computer.
18. Work has become more difficult with the increase of automation in aviation and banking.
19. I do not like to use ATMs because I feel that they are sometimes unreliable.
20. I think that automated devices used in medicine, such as CAT-scans and ultrasound, provide very reliable medical diagnosis.
