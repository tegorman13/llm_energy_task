Perrig, S. A. C., Scharowski, N., & Brühlmann, F. (2023). Trust Issues with Trust Scales: Examining the Psychometric Quality of Trust Measures in the Context of AI. *Extended Abstracts of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, 1–7. https://doi.org/10.1145/3544549.3585808

## 1. Trust Scale for Explainable AI (TXAI) - Adapted Version

*Source: Hoffman et al. [13], adapted by Perrig et al. (2023) by substituting "tool" with "AI".*
*Scale: 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = "I disagree strongly" to 5 = "I agree strongly")*
*Note: Item 6 is negatively formulated and was reverse-coded for analysis in the paper.*

1.  I am confident in the AI. I feel that it works well.
2.  The outputs of the AI are very predictable.
3.  The AI is very reliable. I can count on it to be correct all the time.
4.  I feel safe that when I rely on the AI I will get the right answers.
5.  The AI is efficient in that it works very quickly.
6.  I am wary of the AI. (R)
7.  The AI can perform the task better than a novice human user.
8.  I like using the AI for decision making.

## 2. Trust between People and Automation (TPA) Scale - Adapted Version

*Source: Jian et al. [17], adapted by Perrig et al. (2023) by prefixing "AI-" to "system".*
*Scale: 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = "not at all" to 7 = "extremely")*
*Note: Items 1-5 are reverse-coded items (phrased negatively/representing distrust) and were re-coded prior to data analysis in the paper.*

1.  The AI-system is deceptive (R)
2.  The AI-system behaves in an underhanded manner (R)
3.  I am suspicious of the AI-system's intent, action or, outputs (R)
4.  I am wary of the AI-system (R)
5.  The AI-system's actions will have a harmful or injurious outcome (R)
6.  I am confident in the AI-system
7.  The AI-system provides security
8.  The AI-system has integrity
9.  The AI-system is dependable
10. The AI-system is reliable
11. I can trust the AI-system
12. I am familiar with the AI-system

## 3. Uncertainty Assessment Item

*Source: Perrig et al. (2023), Section 2.1*
*Scale: 7-point Likert-type response scale (1 = "not at all severe" to 7 = "extremely severe")*
*Item Prompt (Inferred from description):* Participants were asked to rate the severity of "the prospect of not getting paid due to poor performance". (The exact phrasing of the question posed to participants is not provided in the paper, only the concept they rated).

*   How severe is the prospect of not getting paid due to poor performance? [1 - Not at all severe ... 7 - Extremely severe]
