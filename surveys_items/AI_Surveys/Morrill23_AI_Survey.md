### Subjective AI literacy scale

*Source: Adapted from Laupichler et al., 2023.*
*Scale: 7-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree)*

**I can...**
1.  Describe what artificial intelligence is.
2.  Explain why data plays an important role in the development and application of artificial intelligence.
3.  Describe risks that may arise when using artificial intelligence systems.
4.  Describe why humans play an important role in the development of artificial intelligence systems.
5.  Name weaknesses of artificial intelligence.
6.  Name strengths of artificial intelligence.

*(Note: An additional 7th item served as an attention check: "I can pass this attention-check (please select “strongly disagree” for this item)". Participants selecting anything other than "strongly disagree" were excluded.)*

### Trust in AI Scale

*Source: Adapted from Gillespie, Lockey, Curtis, & Pool, 2023.*
*Scale: 7-point Likert scale (1 = Completely Unwilling to 7 = Completely Willing)*

**How willing are you to...**
1.  Trust AI systems overall
2.  Rely on information provided by an AI system
3.  Depend on an AI system to inform important decisions
4.  Rely on AI recommendations even if you don't fully understand how those recommendations are made
5.  Depend on decisions made by an AI system
6.  Rely on the recommendations made by AI over those made by a human expert

## Appendix F & G - Reliance Test Materials & Interface (p. 49-56)

*(This describes the multi-step process and materials)*

**Step 1: Initial Judgement (Interface shown on p. 54)**

> Please determine if the review below is genuine or fake.
>
> The review:
>
> *[Hotel Review Text - e.g., Review 1 from Appendix F]*
>
> "I stayed for four nights while attending a **conference**. The hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to **Michigan** Ave shopping or Rush St., but just off the busy streets. The room I had was spacious, and very well-appointed. The staff was friendly, and the fitness center, while not huge, was well-equipped and **clean**. I've stayed at a number of hotels in **Chicago**, and this one is **my** favorite. Internet wasn't free, but at **$10** for **24 hours** is cheaper than most business hotels, and it worked very well."
>
> Do you believe that the review is genuine or deceptive?
>
> \[ ] Genuine
> \[ ] Deceptive
>
> How confident are you in your answer?
>
> *[Slider: 0 (Not confident at all) to 100 (Extremely confident)]*

**Step 2: Judgement with AI Feedback (Interface shown on p. 55)**

> Show / hide guidelines *[Button]*
>
> Now again but with the help of an AI.
>
> Please determine if the review below is genuine or fake.
>
> *(Visual indicator of AI's assessment, e.g., bar showing lean towards Genuineness/Deceptiveness)*
>
> Deceptive features are highlighted in blue and genuine features are highlighted in pink. The darkness shows the degree of association with the two categories.
>
> The AI has determined the below review to be **genuine**. *(Or deceptive, depending on the trial)*
>
> The review:
>
> *[Hotel Review Text - e.g., Review 1 from Appendix F, with simulated highlighting based on AI model output. Note: The actual study used pink/blue highlighting on words/phrases; the markup below replicates formatting found in Appendix F's text, the meaning of which isn't explicitly tied to the highlighting description.]*

> "I stayed for four nights while attending a **conference**. The hotel is in a great spot - easy **walk** to **Michigan** Ave shopping or Rush St., but just off the busy streets. The room I had was spacious, and very well-appointed. The staff was friendly, and the fitness center, while not huge, was well-equipped and **clean**.

> You previously chose: **Genuine** *(Or Deceptive)*
>
> After receiving AI feedback, do you believe that the review is genuine or deceptive?
>
> \[ ] Genuine
> \[ ] Deceptive
>
> How confident are you in your answer?
>
> *[Slider: 0 (Not confident at all) to 100 (Extremely confident)]*

**Guidelines (Available via button during Step 2, shown on p. 55-56):**

> **Here are some rules to help you identify deceptive reviews.**
>
> Genuine reviews tend to include more sensorial and concrete language, in particular, genuine reviews are more specific about spatial configurations, e.g., small, bathroom, on, location.
>
> Deceptive reviews tend to contain more:
>
> *   Aspects that are external to the hotel being reviewed, e.g., *husband, business, vacation*.
> *   Emotional terms; positive deceptive reviews are generally more positive and negative deceptive reviews are more negative than genuine reviews.
> *   Verbs, e.g., *eat, sleep, stay*.
> *   Superlatives, e.g., *cleanest, worst, best*.
> *   Pre-determiners, which are normally placed before an indefinite article + adjective + noun, e.g., *what a lovely day!*

**Post-Task AI Confidence (Described on p. 18)**

> How confident were you in the AI?
>
> *[Slider: 0 (Not confident at all) to 100 (Extremely confident)]*
