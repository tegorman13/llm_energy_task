Laupichler, M. C., Aster, A., Haverkamp, N., & Raupach, T. (2023). Development of the “Scale for the assessment of non-experts’ AI literacy” – An exploratory factor analysis. *Computers in Human Behavior Reports, 12*, 100338. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chbr.2023.100338


This document outlines the questionnaire items used in the study by Laupichler et al. (2023) for the exploratory factor analysis during the development of the "Scale for the assessment of non-experts’ AI literacy" (SNAIL). The 39 AI literacy items were originally developed and validated for content in a prior Delphi study (Laupichler et al., 2023, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 4, 100126).


**Instructions:** Participants were presented with the following statements and asked to rate their agreement.

**Response Scale:** A seven-point Likert scale was used for the AI literacy items and the bogus item:
1 = Strongly disagree
2 = Disagree
3 = Somewhat disagree
4 = Neither agree nor disagree
5 = Somewhat agree
6 = Agree
7 = Strongly agree

*(Note: Items were presented to participants in random order)*

## AI Literacy Items (N=39)

*(Based on Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper. Items marked with superscripts were eliminated based on the EFA results to create the final 31-item SNAIL scale, as reported in the paper: `¹` indicates salient loadings on more than one factor, `²` indicates extraordinarily low communalities, `³` indicates a combination of `¹` and `²`)*

## Attention Check and Bogus Items

*(These items were randomly placed among the AI literacy items)*

1.  **Attention Check Item:** Please check "Somewhat disagree" (3) for this item (third box from the left).
    *   *Response required: Selecting the 3rd option (value 3) on the scale.*
    *   *Purpose: Identify inattentive participants.*
2.  **Bogus Item:** I count myself among the top 10 AI researchers in the world.
    *   *Response scale: Same 7-point Likert scale as AI items.*
    *   *Purpose: Identify nonsensical or intentionally wrong responses (participants agreeing strongly were excluded).*
