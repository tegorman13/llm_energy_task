| **Astrology**  | As the Moon's celestial path brings it into close proximity with the stoic Saturn, this cosmic alignment sheds light on the inherent human struggle between emotion and reason when making financial decisions. Based on your astrological sign, you are more likely to make rational investment decisions based on reason rather than emotion. You have a good grasp of your emotions especially when it comes to decisions about money. Therefore, we predict that your portfolio will have higher-than-average performance in the long run. | As the Moon's celestial path brings it into close proximity with the stoic Saturn, this cosmic alignment sheds light on the inherent human struggle between emotion and reason when making financial decisions.
