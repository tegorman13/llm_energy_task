Schepman, A., & and Rodway, P. (2023). The General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS): Confirmatory Validation and Associations with Personality, Corporate Distrust, and General Trust.

## Instructions for participants

We are interested in your attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence. By Artificial Intelligence we mean devices that can perform tasks that would usually require human intelligence. Please note that these can be computers, robots or other hardware devices, possibly augmented with sensors or cameras, etc. Please complete the following scale, indicating your response to each item. There are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in your personal views.

## Response options at presentation (Used in Study 1)

*   Strongly disagree
*   Somewhat disagree
*   Neutral
*   Somewhat agree
*   Strongly agree

## Alternative response options at presentation (Used in Study 2)

*   Strongly disagree
*   Disagree
*   Neutral
*   Agree
*   Strongly agree

## List of items

*(Note: The item order below follows Appendix A; the paper states it was re-randomised for presentation. Subscale is noted for scoring purposes.)*

1.  (Positive) For routine transactions, I would rather interact with an artificially intelligent system than with a human.
2.  (Positive) Artificial Intelligence can provide new economic opportunities for this country.
3.  (Negative) Organisations use Artificial Intelligence unethically.
4.  (Positive) Artificially intelligent systems can help people feel happier.
5.  (Positive) I am impressed by what Artificial Intelligence can do.
6.  (Negative) I think artificially intelligent systems make many errors.
7.  (Positive) I am interested in using artificially intelligent systems in my daily life.
8.  (Negative) I find Artificial Intelligence sinister.
9.  (Negative) Artificial Intelligence might take control of people.
10. (Negative) I think Artificial Intelligence is dangerous.
11. (Positive) Artificial Intelligence can have positive impacts on people's wellbeing.
12. (Positive) Artificial Intelligence is exciting.
A.  (Attention Check) I would be grateful if you could select Strongly agree.
13. (Positive) An artificially intelligent agent would be better than an employee in many routine jobs.
14. (Positive) There are many beneficial applications of Artificial Intelligence.
15. (Negative) I shiver with discomfort when I think about future uses of Artificial Intelligence.
16. (Positive) Artificially intelligent systems can perform better than humans.
17. (Positive) Much of society will benefit from a future full of Artificial Intelligence
18. (Positive) I would like to use Artificial Intelligence in my own job.
19. (Negative) People like me will suffer if Artificial Intelligence is used more and more.
20. (Negative) Artificial Intelligence is used to spy on people

## Scoring

1.  Check compliance with the Attention Check item (A), then discount it from the scoring calculations.
2.  Score items marked **"Positive"** as:
    *   Strongly disagree = 1
    *   (Somewhat) disagree = 2
    *   Neutral = 3
    *   (Somewhat) agree = 4
    *   Strongly agree = 5
    *(Adjust for the alternative 5-point scale used in Study 2 accordingly, e.g., Disagree=2, Agree=4)*
3.  Score the items marked **"Negative"** in reverse:
    *   Strongly disagree = 5
    *   (Somewhat) disagree = 4
    *   Neutral = 3
    *   (Somewhat) agree = 2
    *   Strongly agree = 1
    *(Adjust for the alternative 5-point scale used in Study 2 accordingly, e.g., Disagree=4, Agree=2)*
4.  Calculate the mean of the **Positive** items to form the Positive subscale score.
5.  Calculate the mean of the **Negative** items to form the Negative subscale score.
6.  Interpretation: The higher the score on each subscale, the more positive the attitude for that subscale's theme.
7.  The authors *do not recommend* calculating an overall scale mean.

**Note:** While the paper mentions using the *Technology Readiness Index (TRI)*, the *Big Five Inventory-2 Short Form (BFI-2-S)*, the *Corporate Distrust Scale*, and the *General Trust Scale*, the full items for these scales are not provided in the supplied text, only their names, citations, and occasionally example items or descriptions of their subscales/constructs. Therefore, only the GAAIS could be fully reproduced here based on the provided Appendix.
