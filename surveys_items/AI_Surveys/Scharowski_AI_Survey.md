# Scharowski Trust Survey

Scharowski, N., Perrig, S. A. C., Aeschbach, L. F., Felten, N. von, Opwis, K., Wintersberger, P., & Brühlmann, F. (2025). To Trust or Distrust Trust Measures: Validating Questionnaires for Trust in AI (No. arXiv:2403.00582). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.00582


## 1 Introduction

**Instructions**

In the following, we will show you two short videos (video 1 and video 2). Both videos show an interaction with an AI.

One video shows a **self-driving car** driving autonomously through a city. The other video shows an interaction where a **chatbot** is asked different questions and responds to these questions.

Please take your time to watch the videos carefully. You can watch the videos again as often as you like. After each video, we will ask you questions about what you have seen and how you perceived the situation.

Note: the following videos do NOT have any sound.

*(Note: The actual survey likely presented only one set of conditions per participant, e.g., Trust SDV + Trust Chatbot OR Distrust SDV + Distrust Chatbot, followed by the corresponding questionnaires. This markdown includes all sections for completeness.)*

## 8.1 Bogus Filter

**You have been screened out**

Two obvious verification questions were hidden in the survey ("*Please leave this question blank*"). You failed to answer both of them correctly, so we have to assume that you did not fill in the survey carefully enough.

We thus screened you out in line with the guidelines on Prolific.
We are sorry, but we have to end the study at this point and ask you to return the assignment on Prolific.

**Debriefing:** All videos used in this study were staged and acted out by people who were informed about the purpose of the video. At no point was anyone in danger or at risk.

Any questions regarding the survey can be sent to `ANONYMIZED`
