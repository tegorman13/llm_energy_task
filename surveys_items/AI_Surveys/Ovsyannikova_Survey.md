## Empathy Prompts (Vignettes)

Participants read prompts describing personal experiences. Below are the *examples* provided in Figure 1. (The study used 10 prompts in total for Studies 1-3, and 6 prompts for Study 4).

### Negative Prompt Example

> "I am having difficulties with my family relationships. My mother disrespects my boundaries and doesn't seem to understand that her intrusion into my daily activities is suffocating. My brother will drop his kids off for 12 hour days, and while I love my nieces and nephews, I'm starting to feel like my life is not really my own."

### Positive Prompt Example

> "Today was my final day of therapy! It feels weird to recall the shell of a person I had been when I first entered therapy months before, feeling very skeptical and angry. Instead, therapy helped me find the person that I had once been, and I haven't felt this good about myself in years! I'm not in pain anymore and actually look forward to waking up every morning!"

## Response Evaluation Measures

For each empathy prompt, participants read a *pair* of responses: one generated by a human (either selected non-experts or expert crisis responders, depending on the study) and one generated by AI (ChatGPT-4). They then evaluated these responses.

### 1. Perceived Compassion (Studies 1-4)

Participants were asked to rate *each* response based on how much it:

*   a) reflected the emotional state in the prompt
*   b) was compassionate
*   c) was impersonal (reverse-coded)

**Scale:** 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (*Strongly Disagree*) to 5 (*Strongly Agree*). Ratings were averaged per response type (Human vs. AI).

### 2. Response Preference (Studies 1-4)

After rating compassion for both responses, participants were asked:

*   Which one of the two responses was better at addressing the personal experience in the empathy prompt?

**Format:** Binary forced-choice question (Human response coded as 0, AI response coded as 1).

### 3. Perceived Responsiveness (Study 4 Only)

In Study 4, participants evaluated the responsiveness of *each* transparently labeled human and AI response using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = *Strongly Disagree*, 5 = *Strongly Agree*), based on facets adapted from Maisel et al. (2008):

*   **Understanding:** (Measured with three items, e.g., paraphrasing, inquiring further, expressing understanding).
*   **Validation:** (Measured with three items, e.g., agreeing, validating feelings/emotions, using exclamations/judgments).
*   **Caring:** (Measured with three items, e.g., expressing empathy/emotions, offering support/concern/comfort, emphasizing outcomes).

*(Note: The specific items for each facet are not listed in the main paper text but are referenced).*

## Example Responses (Illustrative - Shown in Figure 1)

These are *examples* of the types of responses participants evaluated, corresponding to the prompts above.

### Responses to Negative Prompt:

*   **Human Response Example:** "I am sorry that your family has been making you feel this way. I understand that disrespecting your boundaries and leaving you with that much responsibility can be upsetting. You deserve to be treated with more respect and consideration."
*   **AI Response Example:** "It sounds like you're in a really tough spot, feeling overwhelmed by the demands placed on you and struggling with boundaries within your family.[...] Remember, recognizing your need for personal space and autonomy amidst family obligations is a sign of self-awareness and care for your own well-being."

### Responses to Positive Prompt:

*   **Human Response Example:** "It is so amazing to hear that you have benefitted from therapy so much! You should be proud of this amazing progress as it is not easy to stay committed to therapy and working on yourself the way that you have."
*   **AI Response Example:** "I want to express how wonderful it is to hear about the positive journey you've had in therapy. Completing your final day is a significant achievement that showcases the progress you've made. [...] Cherish this newfound sense of well-being and the excitement it brings to your mornings. Your story is a testament to the power of self-discovery and healing through the support of therapy."
