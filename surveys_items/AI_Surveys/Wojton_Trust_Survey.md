## Scoring:

*   Average items 1, 3, 4, and 8 to get the **‘Understanding’** score.
*   Average items 2, 5, 6, 7, & 9 to get the **‘Performance’** score.
*   *Note:* Items are **not** validated to be examined individually or by looking at the average of all items.

*Self-Correction Note: The paper also mentions an initial 14-item version (Table 1) before validation led to the removal of reverse-scored and some process items. The version above reflects the final 9-item scale (Table 2 and Figure 1) recommended by the authors.*
*The study also used single-item measures for overall trust ("I trust the system.") and reliance intentions ("I would recommend others who are placed in this situation use [System Name]..." and "If placed in a similar situation in real life, I would rely on the [System Name]..."). These were not part of the TOAST scale itself.*
