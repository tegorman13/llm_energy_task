Morales-García, W. C., Sairitupa-Sanchez, L. Z., Morales-García, S. B., & Morales-García, M. (2024). Adaptation and psychometric properties of a brief version of the general self-efficacy scale for use with artificial intelligence (GSE-6AI) among university students. Frontiers in Education, 9. https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2024.1293437

**Description:** This scale measures perceived self-efficacy in using Artificial Intelligence. It is an adaptation of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE-6).

**Instructions:** Please respond to each statement indicating how true it is for you.

**Response Scale:**
The paper states the scale uses response options ranging from:
1 = *Not at all true*
to
4 = *Exactly true*

*(Note: While the paper specifies anchors 1 and 4, typical 4-point Likert scales might label the intermediate points as 2 = Hardly true and 3 = Moderately true, though this specific labeling for points 2 and 3 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text for this adaptation.)*

**Items (English version from Table 3):**

1.  If someone opposes me, I can find means and ways to get what I want by using artificial intelligence.
2.  It's easy for me to stay true to my goals and achieve my objectives with the help of artificial intelligence.
3.  I am confident that I could efficiently face unexpected events by using artificial intelligence.
4.  Thanks to my wit supported by artificial intelligence, I know how to handle unforeseen situations.
5.  I can stay calm when facing difficulties because I trust in my coping skills backed by artificial intelligence.
6.  No matter what comes up, I can usually handle it with the support of artificial intelligence.
