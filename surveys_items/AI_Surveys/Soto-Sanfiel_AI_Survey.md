## Scale Items

### Theme 1: What is AI?

#### Sub-theme 1a: RUI (Recognizing AI, Understanding Intelligence and Interdisciplinarity)

*   **is_01:** AI uses algorithms to learn from data and performs tasks that require intelligence.
*   **is_02:** The use of massive data helps some AI algorithms to improve their performance.
*   **is_03:** AI is applied to recognizing human speech.
*   **is_04:** The ability to learn from experience is a feature of intelligence.
*   **is_05 (R):** Human intelligence is the only form of intelligence that can be considered true intelligence.
*   **is_06:** The ability to use tools and manipulate the environment is a form of intelligence.
*   **is_07:** Artificial intelligence can be programmed to perform a wide range of tasks with precision and consistency, surpassing the specific abilities of children's intelligence.
*   **is_08 (R):** The humanities have no place in artificial intelligence.
*   **is_09 (R):** AI is a single technology.
*   **is_10:** Computer Vision is an example of interdisciplinary AI technology.

#### Sub-theme 1b: General vs Narrow

*   **is_11:** Narrow AI defines algorithms which solve specific problems.
*   **is_12:** Task-specific AI is called narrow AI.
*   **is_13:** AI can be divided into specific sub-fields such as general AI and narrow AI.
*   **is_14:** Narrow AI systems are tailored to specific tasks and domains.

### Theme 2: What can AI do?

*   **ca_01:** AI excels at performing well in complex environments, such as driving on crowded streets.
*   **ca_02:** Because it is a cross-cultural topic, AI applies equally well across all countries.
*   **ca_03:** High-stakes decisions are best left to AI because it is more neutral than humans.
*   **ca_04:** Current AI are fully capable of performing complex associations as humans do.
*   **ca_05:** AI is efficient in solving problems that involve emotions.

### Theme 3: How does AI Work?

*   **ho_01:** Some AI systems can represent visual or auditory patterns.
*   **ho_02:** Examples of knowledge representation include decision trees and Bayesian networks.
*   **ho_03:** Knowledge representation plays a crucial role in machine learning by creating feature representations from raw data.
*   **ho_04:** Rule-based systems are one example of how computers can reason.
*   **ho_05 (R):** Computers can only reason and make decisions in a way that is identical to how humans do.
*   **ho_06:** Machine learning is used to predict, cluster, and classify large amounts of data.
*   **ho_07:** Deep learning is a type of machine learning.
*   **ho_08:** Machine learning algorithms learn from data.
*   **ho_09:** In machine learning, datasets are frequently split into a training set and test set.
*   **ho_10:** Model selection is an important step in the machine learning process.
*   **ho_11:** Biased data perpetuates social stereotypes.
*   **ho_12:** Data is subject to interpretation.
*   **ho_13:** Some data used in AI is constructed in a particular cultural setting, which can influence the outcome of models that use the data.
*   **ho_14 (R):** Since data is objective, machine learning models are unbiased.
*   **ho_15:** The data used to train a machine learning model can be biased.
*   **ho_16:** Bias in the data used to train a machine learning model can lead to biased outcomes.
*   **ho_17:** Human oversight is necessary to ensure that AI systems are used ethically and responsibly.
*   **ho_18 (R):** The role of humans in AI development is limited to monitoring AI system's performance.
*   **ho_19:** Autonomous driving is an application area of AI.
*   **ho_20:** Robots can not only act on the world but also react.
*   **ho_21:** Microphones are a type of sensor that is used in robotics.
*   **ho_22:** Sensors help a robot make sense of its environment.
*   **ho_23:** Sensors are devices that detect and convert measurable physical properties into a digital format.

### Theme 4: How should AI be used?

*   **et_01:** To achieve greater transparency, the source code, data use, evidence base for AI use, limitations and responsibility should be communicated.
*   **et_02:** AI must be created in accordance to democratic and societal issues.
*   **et_03:** It is necessary to develop and strengthen rules and laws, including right to appeals, redress or remedy for AI solutions.
*   **et_04:** AI should inform of the underlying reasons and processes that may lead to potential harm.
*   **et_05:** AI developers, designers, institutions, or industry should be accountable for AI actions.
*   **et_06:** Privacy should be assured by AI design, access control, public awareness and regulatory approaches.
*   **et_07:** AI development must be aligned with human values and human rights.
*   **et_08:** Trusted AI must include reliability, accountability, process to monitor and evaluate the integrity of AI systems over time.
*   **et_09:** AI should not diminish or destroy but respect, preserve or even increase human dignity.
*   **et_10:** The benefits of AI must not threaten social cohesion and respect potentially vulnerable persons and groups.
