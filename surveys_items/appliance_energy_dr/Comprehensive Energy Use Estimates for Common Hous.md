# Comprehensive Energy Use Estimates for Common Household Appliances

This report provides meticulously sourced energy consumption data for common household appliances in the United States, intended as a ground truth dataset for evaluating energy-related knowledge of AI models.

## Kitchen Appliances

### Refrigerator (18 cu. ft., ENERGY STAR, Frost-Free)

Refrigerators represent one of the largest continuous energy consumers in homes since they operate 24/7. A typical modern ENERGY STAR refrigerator with frost-free technology consumes between 350-780 kWh per year. The actual power draw ranges from 350-780 watts but fluctuates as the compressor cycles on and off throughout the day. Older 15 cu. ft. models from around 2000 use significantly more energy (approximately 72 kWh per month or 864 kWh annually)[^3].

### Microwave Oven (Countertop, 1000W cooking power)

Microwave ovens typically consume between 600-1500 watts (average 925W) when operating. Despite this relatively high wattage, their total energy consumption is modest at 75-90 kWh per year due to short usage periods (typically 15-30 minutes daily). An important distinction is that the stated cooking power (e.g., 1000W) is the output power, while the input power drawn from the wall is typically higher[^7].

### Electric Range Oven

A standard electric oven consumes approximately 2.3 kWh per hour when operating at around 350°F[^3]. The power draw ranges from 2000-3000 watts but cycles on and off to maintain temperature. Self-cleaning cycles significantly increase energy consumption, using approximately 6 kWh per cleaning cycle[^3].

### Dishwasher (ENERGY STAR)

ENERGY STAR dishwashers use between 1-2.17 kWh per load, with their heating element drawing 1200-1500 watts when actively heating water. Annual consumption for energy-efficient models is less than 270 kWh/year. Using the energy-saver cycle can reduce consumption to approximately 0.5 kWh per load[^3].

### Coffee Maker (Drip)

A typical drip coffee maker uses 0.12 kWh per brew cycle and draws between 900-1200 watts while actively brewing. Models with keep-warm functions consume additional energy (approximately 0.4 kWh per hour) when keeping coffee warm[^3].

### Instant Pot (Multi-cooker, 6-quart)

The popular Instant Pot consumes about 1000 watts when operating, resulting in approximately 520 kWh per year with regular use (several times weekly)[^5]. This is more energy-efficient than conventional stovetop cooking for many dishes.

## Cooling Appliances

### Central Air Conditioner (3-ton/36,000 BTU)

A typical central air conditioning unit consumes 2500 kWh per year when cooling a 2,000 sq. ft. home in an average climate[^8]. The system draws between 3000-3500 watts when operating. The EPA finds this represents approximately 19% of energy use in typical American homes[^8].

### Window Air Conditioner (10,000 BTU)

Window air conditioners suitable for 400-550 sq. ft. rooms use between 0.73-1.8 kWh per hour when operating at medium settings[^3]. They draw 1000-1500 watts during operation.

### Ceiling Fan (52-inch)

Ceiling fans are remarkably efficient, consuming only 0.025-0.075 kWh per hour at medium to high speeds[^10]. Their power draw ranges from 55-100 watts, making them significantly more energy-efficient than air conditioning[^10].

## Laundry and Cleaning Appliances

### Clothes Washer (Front-Loading, ENERGY STAR)

Front-loading ENERGY STAR washing machines use between 0.5-1.0 kWh per load when using warm water. They draw 400-850 watts during operation and typically use 30% less energy than top-loading models[^11]. Using cold water significantly reduces energy consumption.

### Clothes Dryer (Electric)

Electric clothes dryers are among the highest energy consumers in the laundry room, using 2.5-4 kWh per load and drawing 1800-5000 watts during operation[^3]. ENERGY STAR models use approximately 20% less energy than conventional dryers.

### Vacuum Cleaner (Upright)

Upright vacuum cleaners consume between 0.2-1.2 kWh per hour of use, with power draw ranging from 200-1200 watts[^13]. Suction power isn't always proportional to wattage, with newer models achieving better cleaning with less power[^13].

## Lighting Devices

### LED Light Bulb (General Illumination)

A 10-watt LED bulb providing illumination equivalent to a 60-watt incandescent consumes approximately 7.3 kWh per year when used 2 hours daily[^15]. LED bulbs use approximately 90% less energy than incandescent equivalents[^14].

### Incandescent Light Bulb (60W)

A 60-watt incandescent bulb used 2 hours daily consumes 43.8 kWh per year[^15]. These traditional bulbs convert approximately 90% of energy into heat rather than light.

### CFL Light Bulb (25W)

A 25-watt CFL providing light equivalent to a 100-watt incandescent consumes 18.75 kWh per year when used 2 hours daily. Unlike LEDs, CFLs contain small amounts of mercury and require special disposal.

## Environmental Devices

### Air Purifier (Medium Room)

Medium-room air purifiers typically draw 50 watts when operating, with ranges from 30-250 watts depending on fan speed and filtration type. ENERGY STAR models use approximately 40% less energy than standard units.

### Smart Thermostat

Smart thermostats draw just 3-5 watts of power themselves but can reduce total HVAC energy consumption by approximately 20% annually through optimized operation. Actual savings depend on previous thermostat settings and user behavior patterns.

## Heating Appliances

### Electric Water Heater (50-gallon)

Electric water heaters are major energy consumers, using approximately 3,493 kWh per year (9.5 kWh/day)[^17][^18]. They draw about 4000 watts when actively heating water, typically operating around 3 hours daily to maintain temperature[^18].

### Space Heater (Portable Electric, 1500W)

Portable electric space heaters typically draw 1500 watts at maximum setting, consuming approximately 1.5 kWh per hour of operation[^3]. These are designed for spot heating rather than whole-home heating solutions[^3].

## Computing and Entertainment Devices

### Desktop Computer (Mid-range, with monitor)

Desktop computers used for general tasks typically consume between 0.06-0.25 kWh per hour, drawing 70-200 watts during operation[^19][^20]. Gaming PCs can use significantly more, drawing 300-500 watts during intensive use[^19]. Standby power is much lower at 0.001-0.006 kWh per hour[^3].

### Laptop Computer (Notebook)

Laptops are more energy-efficient than desktops, consuming 0.02-0.05 kWh per hour and drawing 30-70 watts during operation[^19][^20]. Power consumption varies with processor load and screen brightness settings[^19].

### Game Console (Current-Gen)

Modern gaming consoles vary significantly in energy use, with annual consumption ranging from 37 kWh for Nintendo Wii U to 233 kWh for Xbox One[^3]. Power draw varies dramatically depending on whether the console is gaming, streaming, or in standby mode[^3].

## Additional Common Household Appliances

### Clothes Iron

Standard clothes irons draw between 800-2000 watts (average 1100W), consuming approximately 1.08 kWh per hour of operation[^21][^22]. Steam irons typically use more power, averaging around 2200 watts[^22].

### Freezer (Chest, 15 cu. ft.)

Chest freezers are more efficient than upright models, consuming approximately 44 kWh per month (528 kWh annually)[^3]. Their efficiency comes from better cold air retention when opening the lid versus a vertical door[^3].

### Hair Dryer

Hair dryers draw approximately 1500 watts and consume 1.5 kWh per hour of operation[^3]. Despite high wattage, their brief use periods limit overall energy impact[^3].

## Conclusion

This comprehensive dataset provides carefully sourced energy consumption metrics for common household appliances in the United States. The data includes both instantaneous power draw (watts) and energy consumption over time (kWh), with clear context regarding typical usage patterns. This information serves as an excellent foundation for evaluating energy-related knowledge and can support research in energy behavior, cognitive psychology, and human-AI interaction.

The most energy-intensive appliances in typical households are climate control systems (heating and cooling), water heaters, and large kitchen appliances like refrigerators. Meanwhile, the adoption of energy-efficient technologies like LED lighting, ENERGY STAR appliances, and smart thermostats offers significant opportunities for energy savings.
