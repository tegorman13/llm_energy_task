Lundberg, D. C., Tang, J. A., & Attari, S. Z. (2019). Easy but not effective: Why “turning off the lights” remains a salient energy conserving behaviour in the United States. Energy Research & Social Science, 58, 101257. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2019.101257


## SURVEY

Dear Participant,

Please complete this survey on a relevant public policy issue. The survey is anonymous, and no one will know what answers you give. This brief survey should take no more than 10 minutes to complete. Thank you for your time and help with this effort.

Sincerely,

During this survey, please keep the infographic below in mind. Incandescent light bulbs are less energy efficient than CFL (compact fluorescent light) bulbs, and CFL bulbs are less energy efficient than LED (light emitting diode) bulbs.

Assume a friend of yours wants to know which of the two actions below saves the most energy over the course of a month. Which one would you tell them saves the most energy?

|                                               |                                                                          |

How did you choose your previous answer? {Text Box}

As a reminder, you were telling a friend which option saves the most energy over the course of a month: turning off the lights or replacing incandescent light bulbs with more efficient light bulbs.

The most frequent response to “What is the single most effective thing you could do to save energy?” has been "turning off the lights”. While turning off the lights does save some energy, many other actions have the potential to save a lot more energy.

With this in mind, why do you think people continue to list "turning off the lights" as the most effective energy saving action they could do? {Text Box}

| Imagine that we flip a fair coin 1,000 times. What is your best guess about how many times the coin would come up heads in 1,000 flips?                                                            |                      |
| In the BIG BUCKS LOTTERY, the chance of winning a $10 prize is 1%. What is your best guess about how many people would win a $10 prize if 1000 people each buy a single ticket from BIG BUCKS?       |                      |
| In ACME PUBLISHING SWEEPSTAKES, the chance of winning a car is 1 in 1,000. What percent of tickets to ACME PUBLISHING SWEEPSTAKES win a car?                                                        |                      |
| Out of 1,000 people in a small town 500 are members of a choir. Out of these 500 members in the choir 100 are men. Out of the 500 inhabitants that are not in the choir 300 are men. What is the probability that a randomly drawn man is a member of the choir? Please indicate the probability in percent. |                      |
| Imagine we are throwing a five-sided die 50 times. On average, out of these 50 throws how many times would this five-sided die show an odd number (1, 3 or 5)?                                      |                      |
| Imagine we are throwing a loaded die (6 sides). The probability that the die shows a 6 is twice as high as the probability of each of the other numbers. On average, out of these 70 throws how many times would the die show the number 6? |                      |
| In a forest 20% of mushrooms are red, 50% brown and 30% white. A red mushroom is poisonous with a probability of 20%. A mushroom that is not red is poisonous with a probability of 5%. What is the probability that a poisonous mushroom in the forest is red? |                      |
