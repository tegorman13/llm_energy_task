## Initial Self-Assessment Questions

*(These questions were asked at the beginning of the survey, before the main subscales. Response scales varied as indicated below).*

1.  How much do you feel you know about energy?
    *(Response Scale: 5-point - Nothing, Not Much, Medium, Quite a Bit, A Lot)*
2.  When it comes to energy use, how would you describe yourself?
    *(Response Scale: 5-point - High energy user, Moderately high energy user, Medium energy user, Sometimes I try to save, I almost always try to save)*
3.  How often do you talk to your family about ways you can save energy in and around your home?
    *(Response Scale: 5-point - Not at all, Maybe once or twice, Only a little bit, A fair amount, A lot)*
