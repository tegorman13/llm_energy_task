## 1. Measuring understanding

### Understanding: Historical use information

1.  True / False: The highest electricity use was 1800kWh.\*
2.  True / False: The lowest electricity use was 700kWh.\*
3.  True / False: Just looking at the winter months (Dec, Jan, Feb), the Smiths tend to use the most on electricity in February.
4.  True / False: The Smith's home used more electricity in February 2011 than February 2012.
5.  True / False: The Smith's home used the most electricity in August.
6.  True / False: The Smith's home used the most electricity in the summer months (Jun, Jul, Aug).
7.  True / False: Every month, the Smith's electricity use was above 600kWh.\*

### Understanding: Neighbor comparison information

1.  True / False: The Smith's neighbors vary in how much electricity they use.
2.  True / False: 18 homes used less electricity than the Smith's home.
3.  True / False: The Smith's home used more electricity than most of their neighbors.
4.  True / False: The Smith's home should use less electricity to be closer to the neighborhood average.
5.  True / False: Most homes used more than 300kWh of electricity.\*
6.  True / False: There is a difference of about 696kWh between the home that used the most and the least electricity.\*
7.  True / False: The maximum amount of electricity used by the Smith's neighbors was about 279kWh.\*

### Understanding: Appliance breakdown information

1.  True / False: In January 2011, the Smiths used the most electricity for space heating.
2.  True / False: In May 2011, the Smiths used the most electricity for running their "other" appliances.
3.  True / False: The Smith's home used less electricity in January 2011 than in January 2012.
4.  True / False: The Smith's use 300-400kWh of electricity a month for “other” appliances.\*
5.  True / False: The difference in usage for lighting and kitchen appliances is never more than 100kWh.\*
6.  True / False: The main reason why the Smith's electricity use changes from month-to-month is because of lighting.
7.  True / False: Without heat or air-conditioning, the Smiths would probably use between 400-500kWh per month.\*

# SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS – INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN ENERGY LITERACY

*Energy literacy questions adapted from DeWaters and Powers (2011)*

1.  The amount of ELECTRICAL ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) we use is measured in units called ...
    -   Kilowatt (kW)
    -   **Kilowatt-hours (kWh)**
    -   British Thermal Units (BTU)
    -   Volts (V)
    -   Horsepower (HP)

2.  The amount of ENERGY consumed by an electrical appliance is equal to the power rating of the appliance (watts or kilowatts) ...
    -   Multiplied by the cost of electricity
    -   Added to the cost of electricity
    -   **Multiplied by the time it's used**
    -   Divided by the time it's used
    -   Added to the time it's used

3.  When you turn on an incandescent light bulb, which of the following energy conversion takes place?
    -   Electrical energy to radient energy (light)
    -   Chemical energy to radient energy (light)
    -   **Electrical energy to radient energy (light) and thermal energy (heat)**
    -   Chemical energy to radient energy (light) and thermal energy (heat)
    -   Electrical energy to radient energy (light) and mechanical energy

4.  The best reason to buy an ENERGY STAR® appliance is ...
    -   ENERGY STAR appliances are usually bigger
    -   ENERGY STAR appliances cost more
    -   **ENERGY STAR appliances use less energy**
    -   ENERGY STAR appliances are more modern looking
    -   ENERGY STAR appliances cost less

5.  Which uses the MOST ENERGY in the average American home in one year?
    -   Refrigerating food and beverages
    -   Washing and drying clothing
    -   **Heating and cooling rooms**
    -   Heating and cooling water
    -   Lighting the home

6.  Which of the following items uses the MOST ELECTRICITY in the average home in one year?
    -   Lights
    -   **Refrigerator**
    -   Telephone
    -   Television
    -   Computer

7.  Which of the following sources provides most of the ELECTRICITY in the United States?
    -   Nuclear power
    -   Burning petroleum
    -   **Burning coal**
    -   Solar energy
    -   Water (hydro) power

8.  Some people think that if we run out of fossil fuels we can just switch over to electric cars. What is wrong with this idea?
    -   **Most electricity is currently produced from fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)**
    -   Switching to electric cars will make unemployment rates go up
    -   It has been proven that it is impossible to build electric cars in great quantities
    -   You can't use electricity to operate a car
    -   There is nothing wrong with this idea
