Please answer the following using only prior knowledge.
Think about an average household in the United States. Now think about the total amount of energy that is used directly by that household in one year.
Consider that the energy used by a household can be divided into:
*   Household operations: electricity, natural gas, and heating oil that is used for the house
*   Transportation: air travel, motor travel, and public transportation used by people in the household
*   Food production: growing and shipping food that people in the household eat.

What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to each of the following categories?
*   % household operations: [slider bar response option ranging between 0 and 100]
*   % transportation: [slider bar response option ranging between 0 and 100]
*   % food production: [slider bar response option ranging between 0 and 100]

### Supplementary Note 2: Studies 1C and 1D - Sensitivity of Results to Reference Unit

To examine the sensitivity of our findings to the reference unit used, we replicated Study 1A and 1B with a different sample and food reference unit. We randomly allocated 1,009 participants recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk to either Study 1C (estimating energy consumption) or Study 1D (estimating GHG emissions). The studies were available only to people in the United States. The materials and procedure were nearly identical to Study 1A and 1B except that the reference unit provided for energy consumption and GHG emissions was in terms of both a “medium-sized tomato” as well as the use of “a 100-watt incandescent light bulb for one hour". Both items were said to consume 100 units of energy (in Study 1C) or emit 100 units of GHG emissions (in Study 1D).

The 507 participants allocated to Study 1C ranged in age from 18 to 75 years with a mean of 33.5 (SD = 10.4). Among the survey respondents, 58% were female and 70% were employed full-time or part-time. Racially, 74% were non-Hispanic White, 6% Hispanic, 8% African American, and 10% Asian. Politically, 39% identified as Democrats, 38% as Independent, and 18% as Republican.

The 505 participants allocated to Study 1D ranged in age from 19 to 80 years with a mean of 34.5 (SD = 11.6). Among the survey respondents, 55% were female and 70% were employed full-time or part-time. Racially, 75% were non-Hispanic White, 5% Hispanic, 9% African American, and 9% Asian. Politically, 42% identified as Democrats, 32% as Independent, and 21% as Republican.

Figure S1 shows participants' estimated energy used plotted against actual energy consumed after transforming both distributions with base-10 logarithms to reduce positive skew. Figure S2 shows participants' estimated GHG emissions plotted against actual GHG emissions after transforming both distributions with base-10 logarithms to reduce positive skew. We ran the same mixed models as those reported in the main analysis. A summary of the models is provided in Table S1.

Compared to the main studies (that provided only an appliance reference unit), the replication studies (that provided both an appliance and a food reference unit) produced lines of best fit that were steeper and with less negative intercepts. Although the size of the difference between appliances and foods was reduced it remained statistically significant, thus supporting our main conclusion that consumers underestimate foods more than appliances.

*Figure S1: Mean estimates of energy used relative to actual energy used. The red fitted line depicts the relationship between the actual energy consumed throughout the life-cycle of 18 foods (x-axis) and the estimates provided by Study 1A participants (y-axis). The blue fitted line depicts the actual energy used of 18 electrical appliances (x-axis) and the estimates provided by Study 1A participants (y-axis). Accurate estimates would produce a set of points that fall along the grey 45-degree line. As shown, participants underestimated the energy consumption of all foods and almost all appliances (with the exception of CFL light bulbs, laptop computers, and DVD players). The underestimation was greater for foods than for appliances. Note that all estimates are expressed in terms of “Energy Units" and participants were told that producing and transporting a medium-sized tomato uses 100 Energy Units. All data are logged. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.*

*Note: The independent variable domain refers to whether participants were estimating foods (coded "1") or appliances (coded “0”). The independent variable actual, which was logged and mean-centered, refers to the actual energy consumed or GHG emissions for each item.

Coefficients are unstandardized. \*\*\*p < 0.001, \*\*p < 0.01, \*p < 0.05.*

It is worth discussing one aspect of our study that may also have affected the participant's responses. Like previous research, we selected the energy consumed by a 100W light-bulb during one hour as a reference unit, which represents a relatively low energy consumption relative to the energy use of the items being evaluated. This low reference point is likely to have reduced overall estimates because people often make judgments that are too close to the reference point. Although the reference unit may tend to shift all estimates in aggregate, our primary focus was on the relative underestimation of food versus appliances. This inter-domain comparison is not influenced by the specific choice of reference unit. However, a potentially interesting future direction may be to examine between-domain behavior change preferences (e.g., willingness to eat less meat versus use less air conditioning).

### Supplementary Note 3: Actual Life-Cycle Energy Use and GHG Emissions for Different Types of Food and Appliances

The data sources for actual appliance energy use are shown in Table S2. The data reflect the best available information at the time of analysis. Because energy consumption of different appliances depends on its technical specifications, mode of use (e.g., a freezer will consume more electricity if doors are opened frequently), and environmental conditions (e.g., a freezer consumes more electricity if placed in a warmer room), no single estimate of power consumption is correct. In fact, several studies report ranges. However, to assess the accuracy of consumer's perceptions of energy consumption it is necessary to have a best estimate. To get such a value, when a range was given in a source, we used the middle value. When multiple values were available from different sources, we used the arithmetic mean. We then used the arithmetic mean of all sources to produce an “actual” value.

The GHG emissions associated with energy consumption vary depending on the energy mix used in the power grid from which electricity is drawn, and the magnitude of energy losses in the power transmission and distribution. To obtain a best point-estimate of GHG emissions, we used the best-estimates of energy use and assumed: (a) electric power transmission resulted in a 7% loss of electricity, (b) 1.24 pounds of greenhouse gases were emitted per kWh consumed, and c) methane had 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide while nitrous oxide's warming potential was 298 times that of carbon dioxide.

Because it was possible that consumers would provide an estimate of energy use and GHG emissions that deviated from our “actual” value but was nevertheless within the range of values estimated from our sources, we performed a sensitivity analysis on these values (see Supplementary Note 4).

Energy usage and GHG emissions associated with food production, processing, and transportation, depend on a large number of factors and hence, point-estimates of these impacts for generic foods are imprecise. For example, energy use and GHG emissions of vegetables depend on crop type, soil characteristics, hydro climatic conditions, pest and nutrient management, the use of irrigation, number of miles traveled, type of transportation, and storage technology. Nevertheless, our study required a best estimate for each food to compare to consumer perceptions. Our best estimates on energy use and associated GHG emissions of different foods were based on data from the LCA Software & Carbon Footprint Analyzer FoodCarbonScopeTM, produced by the company CleanMetricsTM http://cleanmetrics.net/foodcarbonscope. FoodCarbonScopeTM is a web-based software tool for conducting Environmental Life Cycle Assessments of food. It provides estimates of life-cycle GHG emissions, energy use, and water use in food and beverage products, and has the largest commercially available life cycle inventory database for North American food production and processing. In May 2016 we were granted temporary access to the tool, which allowed us to search for foods that had data from multiple American sources, from which we took the arithmetic mean as our “actual” value. We estimated the serving size and serving size weight. A summary of this analysis is provided in Tables S3 and S4. Note that all values include 1,500 miles of transport by a semi-trailer.

Because it is possible that consumers would provide an estimate of energy use and GHG emissions that deviated from our “actual” value but was nevertheless within the range of values estimated by different sources, we performed sensitivity analysis on these values (see Supplementary Note 4).

### Supplementary Note 4: Studies 1A and 1B - Testing Additional Covariates and Sensitivity of Results to Assumed Actual Values

A within-subjects t-test revealed that the mean individual-level correlation between perceived and actual values was significantly low for foods than for appliances for energy use (Mappliances = .31, SD = .27, vs. Mfood = .24, SD = .25), t(517) = 4.77, p < .0001, and GHG emissions (Mappliances = .28, SD = .28, vs. Mfood= .24, SD = .28), t(513) = 2.18, p = .03. We note that the food items used in our study had a more restricted range of “actual” values (e.g., lowest energy = 93 energy units; highest energy = 1904 energy units) compared to appliances (lowest energy = 32 energy units; highest energy = 3,615 energy units), which can reduce correlations.

In order to examine the effect of covariates in Study 1A and 1B, we ran the same mixed-effect models as described in the main text a second time, now including all of the demographic variables (i.e., Gender [“Male” reference level], Age, Ethnicity [“Other” reference level], Education, Employment [“Homemaker” reference level], Income, Political Orientation – Economic Issues, Political Orientation – Social Issues, Political Party [“Other" reference level], NEPr (i.e., environmental worldview), and Order as covariates. A summary of the models is provided in Table S5.

In Study 1A, in addition to the effects described in the main analysis, there was a significant effect of NEPr indicating that estimates were higher for those who had a more pro-environmental worldview. This observation is consistent with prior research.

In Study 1B, in addition to the effects described in the main analysis, there was a significant effect of NEPr again indicating that estimates were higher for those who had a more pro-environmental worldview. There was a significant effect of gender indicating that estimates were higher for those who were female. This observation is consistent with some prior research (but not all). There was a significant effect of education indicating that estimates were higher for those who were more educated. There was a significant effect of income indicating that estimates were higher for those who reported a higher family income bracket.

To examine the sensitivity of our findings to the *actual* values, we re-ran all analyses reported in the main text for Study 1A and 1B assuming energy consumption and GHG emissions of food and appliances was equal to the minimum rather than the average of the values reported by the different sources.

Figure S3 shows participants' estimated energy used plotted against conservative actual energy consumed after transforming both distributions with base-10 logarithms to reduce positive skew. Figure S4 shows participants' estimated GHG emissions plotted against conservative actual GHG emissions after transforming both distributions with base-10 logarithms to reduce positive skew. We ran the same mixed models as those reported in the main analysis. A summary of the models is provided in Table S6.

Compared to the main analysis, the conservative analysis produced lines of best fit that were shallower and with less negative intercepts. Importantly, the size of the difference between appliances and foods was very similar between analyses, supporting our main conclusion that consumers underestimate foods more than appliances.

*Figure S3: Mean estimates of energy used relative to conservative actual energy used. The red fitted line depicts the relationship between the conservative actual energy consumed throughout the life-cycle of 19 foods (x-axis) and the estimates provided by Study 1A participants (y-axis). The blue fitted line depicts the conservative actual energy used of 18 electrical appliances (x-axis) and the estimates provided by Study 1A participants (y-axis)...*

### Supplementary Note 6: Study 2 - Additional Analyses

We conducted a regression analysis with group, NEPr, scores from the subscales of the Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ; health, mood, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, price, weight control, familiarity, animal welfare, environmental protection, political values, religion [each coded "1" for Strongly Disagree up to “5” for Strongly Agree), and the demographics variables (gender [coded “1” for Man and “2” for Woman], age, race [coded “1” for Caucasian/white, “2” for “African American/black", 3 for Asian/pacific islander, “4” for Hispanic/Latino, “5” for Native American, and “6” for Other], employment status [coded “1” for Employed full time, etc.], education status [coded “1” for Some high school up to “6” for Graduate], political party [coded “1” for Democrat, etc.], household income [coded “0” for $0-9,999 up to "7" for $120,000+], and dietary status [coded “0” for eats red meat and “1” for avoids red meat]) entered as predictor variables, and the average number of beef soups purchased as the outcome variable.

The analysis revealed a significant effect of group, B = -.49, t(97) = -2.93, p = .004, a significant effect of diet type, B = -1.14, t(97) = -5.038, p < .0001, a significant effect for the political values FCQ subscale, B = -.31, t(97) = -2.181, p = .03, a significant effect for the religion FCQ subscale, B = .25, t(97) = 3.01, p = .03, a significant effect for the environmental protection FCQ subscale, B = .34, t(97) = -2.18, p = .03, and a significant effect of education, B = -.153, t(97) = -2.21, p = .03. In sum, those less likely to purchase cans of beef soup were presented with the GHG emissions information, more educated, have a diet that excluded red meat, and self-reported to choose foods that were aligned with their religious, political, and environmental protection values.

We conducted another regression analysis with the same variables entered as predictor variables, and beef-to-vegetable soup GHG emissions ratio purchased as the outcome variable. This analysis once again excluded to two outliers who produced ratios more than six standard deviations from the mean. The analysis revealed a significant effect of group, B = 1.30, t(95) = 3.14, p = .002. No other variables were significant predictors. In sum, those who tended to estimate a higher ratio were presented with the GHG emissions information.

### Supplementary Note 7: Actual Life-Cycle GHG Emissions for a Range of Prepared Soups

For Study 2, the actual values of GHG emissions from the life-cycle of different types of vegetable and beef soup were based on data from the website www.eatlowcarbon.org/food-scores, which was last accessed 23 November 2017. According to this website:
> EatLowCarbon.org was created by Bon Appétit Management Company, a food service pioneer operating hundreds of cafés all over America for corporations, universities, and specialty venues. Bon Appétit is known for tackling pressing social issues such as local food, animal welfare, antibiotics in animal agriculture, farmworker rights, and more. Bon Appétit worked with the nonprofit environmental group Ecotrust to compile and conduct peer-reviewed Life Cycle Assessments from which the information on this site is drawn. Researchers use LCA to calculate the environmental impact of a product's entire life cycle: for food items, that includes the inputs, such as fertilizer, that went into growing it, and the energy that went into transporting, processing and cooking it.

According to an email correspondence with Bon Appétit:
> We hired the organization EcoTrust to compile peer reviewed Life Cycle Assessments for single-ingredient foods and combine them according to “recipes” for the dishes shown on the site. That includes the ingredients, how far they traveled (either “domestic” or “international”) and information about how they were cooked.

The EatLowCarbon.org website listed the following soups:
*   Beef Chili Soup – 1,281 grams of CO2e
*   Chicken Noodle Soup – 253 grams of CO2e
*   Minestrone Soup – 189 grams of CO2e
*   Vegetarian Chili – 86 grams of CO2e
*   Spinach and Pea Stew – 78 grams of CO2e
*   Three Bean Soup – 54 grams of CO2e
*   Lentil Soup - 54 grams of CO2e

In order to generate the values used in Study 2, we took the value for Beef Chili Soup (1,281 g CO2e) and added/subtracted 10% of it (i.e., 128) to create two new values: 1,153 and 1,409. We then allocated these three values to the three beef soups used in the study:
*   Beef Noodle Soup – 1,409 grams of CO2e
*   Beef with Vegetables and Barley Soup – 1,153 grams of CO2e
*   Vegetable Beef Soup – 1,281 grams of CO2e

Similarly, we took the value for Minestrone Soup (189 g CO2e) and added/subtracted 10% of it (i.e., 19) to create two new values: 170 and 208. We then allocated these three values to the three vegetable soups used in the study:
*   Vegetarian Vegetable Soup – 208 grams of CO2e
*   Old Fashioned Vegetable Soup – 170 grams of CO2e
*   Minestrone Soup – 189 grams of CO2e
