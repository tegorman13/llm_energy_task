# Attari et al. 2010 - A Survey on Energy

Attari, S. Z., DeKay, M. L., Davidson, C. I., & Bruine De Bruin, W. (2010). Public perceptions of energy consumption and savings. 

## 1. Energy-Saving Behaviors

In your opinion, what is the most effective thing that you could do to conserve energy in your life?

## 2. Energy Consumed by the Average Household

Think about an average household in the United States.
Now think about the total amount of energy that is used directly by that household in one year.

Consider that the energy used by a household can be divided into household operations, transportation and food production.

Household operations include electricity, natural gas, and heating oil that is used for the house.

Transportation includes air travel, motor travel, and public transportation used by people in the household.

Food production includes growing and shipping food that people in the household eat.
Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs). What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by household operations?

What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by transportation? $\qquad$
What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by food production? $\qquad$

## 3. Energy Used by Devices in One Hour

A 100-Watt incandescent light bulb uses 100 units of energy in one hour.
How many units of energy do you think each of the following devices typically uses in one hour?

Enter a number less than 100 if you think the device uses less energy than a 100-Watt bulb. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the device uses more energy than a

100-Watt bulb. Your best estimates are fine. Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs).
[Error message "Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs)."]

| A compact fluorescent light bulb that is as bright as a 100-Watt <br> incandescent light bulb |  |

| A stereo |  |
| An electric clothes dryer |  |
| A portable heater |  |
| A room air-conditioner |  |
| A central air conditioner |  |
| A dish washer |  |

## 4. Energy Saved in the Household

Turning off a 100-Watt incandescent light bulb for one hour SAVES 100 units of energy. How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Your best estimates are fine.

Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs).

Remember to enter a number of the amount of energy SAVED, not the amount of energy USED.
[Text entered is validated for a whole number between 0 and 1000000. Error message: "Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs)."]

Replacing one 100 -watt incandescent bulb with equally bright compact fluorescent bulb that is used for one hour would reduce energy use by how many units?

Replacing one 100 -watt kitchen bulb with a 75 -watt bulb that is used for one hour would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$
Drying clothes on a clothes line (not using the dryer) for one load of laundry would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$

In the summer: turning up the thermostat on your air conditioner (making your home warmer) by $5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ would reduce energy use by how many units?

In the winter: turning down the thermostat on your heater (making your home cooler) by $5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$
Changing washer temperature settings from "hot wash, warm rinse" to "warm wash, cold rinse" for one load of laundry would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$

## 5. Energy Saved in Transportation

Assume that a 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour uses 100 units of energy in one hour.
(Note that this scale in different from that used in previous questions, in that "100 units" now refers to a different amount of energy.)

How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than is consumed by the 20 -miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than consumed by the 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Your best estimates are fine.

Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs). Remember to enter a number of the amount of energy SAVED, not the amount of energy USED.
[Text entered is validated for a whole number between 0 and 100000000. Error message: "Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs)."]

Driving a more fuel efficient car ( 30 miles per gallon instead of 20 miles per gallon) at 60 miles per hour for one hour would reduce energy use by how many units?

Tuning up the car twice a year (including air filter changes) would reduce energy use by how many units for the whole year? $\qquad$

Assume that you are driving a 20-miles-per-gallon car for 60 miles. Reducing your highway speed from 70 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour would reduce energy use by how many units for the trip? $\qquad$
