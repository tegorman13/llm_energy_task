# Survey Instrument Components from Cotton et al. (2021)

Cotton, D. R. E., Zhai, J., Miller, W., Dalla Valle, L., & Winter, J. (2021). Reducing energy demand in China and the United Kingdom: The importance of energy literacy. Journal of Cleaner Production, 278, 123876. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123876

**Overview:** The survey contained 40 questions exploring energy knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours, using a mix of ranking, Likert-type scales, closed, and open questions. It adapted a previous instrument (Cotton et al., 2015) and incorporated the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale (Dunlap, 2008).

## Section 3: Knowledge Test

*(Based on Section 2.3 and 3.2. Exact wording of questions not provided in the paper)*

This section included questions testing factual knowledge about energy systems and energy saving. Topics covered included:

*   Definition of renewable energy.
*   Understanding of energy efficiency (e.g., meaning of 35% efficiency for a power plant).
*   Technical questions (e.g., which type of light bulb uses least energy).
*   Source of most renewable energy in their respective country (UK/China).
*   Identifying the most energy-saving daily behaviours.

## Section 4: Attitudes

*(Based on Section 2.3, Section 3.3, Table 3)*

Items rated on a **5-point Likert scale** (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Higher scores indicate stronger agreement.

1.  I would do more to save energy if I knew how
2.  The way I personally use energy does not make a difference to the national energy situation
3.  I can influence what the government does about energy problems
4.  I can influence what companies do about energy problems
5.  I trust the government to do something about any energy problems
6.  Scientists will find ways to solve energy problems
7.  More wind farms should be developed to generate electricity, even if they are located in scenic environments
8.  The government should have stronger standards on fuel efficiency of cars
9.  Climate change has been established as a serious problem and immediate action is necessary
10. Climate change is caused by human activities related to using energy
11. There are benefits to people in our country from climate change
12. Behaving sustainably can have health benefits

**Also included:**

*   **New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) Scale (Dunlap, 2008):** Used to measure attitudes towards ecological sustainability (ecocentric vs. technocentric). *The specific items used from the NEP scale are not listed in the paper.*

## Section 5: Behaviours

*(Based on Section 2.3, Section 3.4, Table 4)*

Items rated on a **4-point frequency scale** (1 = never, 4 = always). Higher scores indicate more frequent behaviour.

1.  Turn off lights when they are not in use
2.  Turn down the heat
3.  Try to save water
4.  Walk or cycle short distances instead of going by car
5.  Buy things that are likely to involve less energy or resource use
6.  Pay a bit more for environmentally friendly products
7.  Avoid charging mobile phones overnight
8.  Turn off standby button on the TV or switch appliances off at the plug
9.  Use rechargeable batteries
10. Try to learn what I can do to help solve environmental issues
11. Talk with others about environmental issues
12. Try to convince friends to act responsibly towards the environment
13. Participate in environmental campaigns (including online petitions)
