**Energy and Behavior Survey: SELF-OTHER ORDER**

Dear Participant:

Your involvement in this study will help us understand behaviors related to energy consumption. Thank you for your time and help with this effort.

Please note that participation is voluntary. The survey is anonymous, and no one will know what answers you give. For this reason, please do not type your name or anyone else's name anywhere in the survey. The survey is relatively brief and should not take any more than 10 minutes to complete.

Thank you again for participating in this study. The asterisks denote questions for which you must provide answers for before going to the next screen. If you feel uncomfortable in answering any question, you can exit the survey. On completing the survey, you will be paid via $3 MTurk within 72 hours. There is a limit of one gift certificate per person.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send me an email at:
sattari@indiana.edu.

Sincerely,
Shahzeen Attari
