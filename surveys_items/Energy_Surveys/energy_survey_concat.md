# Attari et al. 2010 - A Survey on Energy

Attari, S. Z., DeKay, M. L., Davidson, C. I., & Bruine De Bruin, W. (2010). Public perceptions of energy consumption and savings. 

## 1. Energy-Saving Behaviors

In your opinion, what is the most effective thing that you could do to conserve energy in your life?

## 2. Energy Consumed by the Average Household

Think about an average household in the United States.
Now think about the total amount of energy that is used directly by that household in one year.

Consider that the energy used by a household can be divided into household operations, transportation and food production.

Household operations include electricity, natural gas, and heating oil that is used for the house.

Transportation includes air travel, motor travel, and public transportation used by people in the household.

Food production includes growing and shipping food that people in the household eat.
Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs). What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by household operations?

What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by transportation? $\qquad$
What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by food production? $\qquad$

## 3. Energy Used by Devices in One Hour

A 100-Watt incandescent light bulb uses 100 units of energy in one hour.
How many units of energy do you think each of the following devices typically uses in one hour?

Enter a number less than 100 if you think the device uses less energy than a 100-Watt bulb. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the device uses more energy than a

100-Watt bulb. Your best estimates are fine. Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs).
[Error message "Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs)."]

| A compact fluorescent light bulb that is as bright as a 100-Watt <br> incandescent light bulb |  |

| A stereo |  |
| An electric clothes dryer |  |
| A portable heater |  |
| A room air-conditioner |  |
| A central air conditioner |  |
| A dish washer |  |

## 4. Energy Saved in the Household

Turning off a 100-Watt incandescent light bulb for one hour SAVES 100 units of energy. How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Your best estimates are fine.

Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs).

Remember to enter a number of the amount of energy SAVED, not the amount of energy USED.
[Text entered is validated for a whole number between 0 and 1000000. Error message: "Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs)."]

Replacing one 100 -watt incandescent bulb with equally bright compact fluorescent bulb that is used for one hour would reduce energy use by how many units?

Replacing one 100 -watt kitchen bulb with a 75 -watt bulb that is used for one hour would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$
Drying clothes on a clothes line (not using the dryer) for one load of laundry would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$

In the summer: turning up the thermostat on your air conditioner (making your home warmer) by $5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ would reduce energy use by how many units?

In the winter: turning down the thermostat on your heater (making your home cooler) by $5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$
Changing washer temperature settings from "hot wash, warm rinse" to "warm wash, cold rinse" for one load of laundry would reduce energy use by how many units? $\qquad$

## 5. Energy Saved in Transportation

Assume that a 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour uses 100 units of energy in one hour.
(Note that this scale in different from that used in previous questions, in that "100 units" now refers to a different amount of energy.)

How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than is consumed by the 20 -miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than consumed by the 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Your best estimates are fine.

Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs). Remember to enter a number of the amount of energy SAVED, not the amount of energy USED.
[Text entered is validated for a whole number between 0 and 100000000. Error message: "Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs)."]

Driving a more fuel efficient car ( 30 miles per gallon instead of 20 miles per gallon) at 60 miles per hour for one hour would reduce energy use by how many units?

Tuning up the car twice a year (including air filter changes) would reduce energy use by how many units for the whole year? $\qquad$

Assume that you are driving a 20-miles-per-gallon car for 60 miles. Reducing your highway speed from 70 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour would reduce energy use by how many units for the trip? $\qquad$

## Definitions

To ensure clarity for the purposes of the survey please utilize the below definitions of electric vehicle and heat pump when answering survey questions.

> **Electric Vehicles** have an electric motor instead of a gasoline combustion engine. They use a large battery pack to store electricity and power the electric motor. Hybrid vehicles are not considered electric vehicles for the purposes of this survey.

> **Heat Pumps** are an electric alternative to furnaces and air conditioners. Heat pumps transfer heat rather than generating heat by burning fuel. During the winter, heat pumps warm your home by moving heat from outdoors to indoors. During the summer, heat pumps cool by moving heat from your house outdoors.

## Phase 1: Norm-Following Task (Based on Fig A.3 - A.6)

**Instructions:**

Here you are in Phase 1 of the experiment. You will decide how to allocate 50 balls between two buckets.
Your task is to put each of the balls, one-by-one, into one of the two buckets: the blue bucket or the yellow bucket. You can allocate each ball by clicking either the "Blue bucket +1" button or the "Yellow bucket +1" button.
For each ball you put in the blue bucket, you will receive 2 points, and for each ball you put in the yellow bucket, you will receive 4 points. Your payoff of Phase 1 will be based on your decisions: it is the sum of points from the blue and yellow buckets.
**The rule is to put the balls in the blue bucket.**
At the end of the experiment, your payoff will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1 and will be paid via Prolific.
If you are still unclear about the task, do not worry. The instructions are available throughout this phase. On the next page, you will be asked to answer two questions to help comprehension.

**Comprehension Questions:**

Q1. How many points will you receive for each ball you put in the **yellow** bucket? Please enter a **number** in the form below.

In Phase 2, you will make a purchase decision for multiple rounds.
In each round, you own **100 initial points**. You will decide how to allocate the points to purchasing the experimental product. Every unit of purchasing costs 1 point (**unit cost = 1 point**), and brings 2 points of benefit (**unit benefit = 2 points**). Your payoff of a round will be:
`payoff = initial points - unit cost * purchase amount + unit benefit * purchase amount`
`= 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount`

Apart from the points, there will be carbon offsets for the amount of 100 kg CO2 (= carbon dioxide, or in short: carbon) at the beginning of each round (**initial carbon offsets = 100 kg**). Purchasing every unit of the experimental product causes **0.5 kg** carbon emissions from its production, which will reduce the initial stock of 100 kg carbon offsets by 0.5 kg (**unit emissions = 0.5 kg**). At the end of each round, the carbon offsets that can be contributed will be:
`carbon offsets contribution = initial carbon offsets - unit emissions * purchase amount`
`= 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount`

*(Note: In the **High Externality** condition, unit emissions = **1 kg**)*

Carbon offsets are used to compensate the carbon emissions from human activities: carbon emissions are reduced by contributing money to environmental projects that reduce emissions, such as reforestation and solar energy generation. The picture visualises the principle of a carbon offset:
[Visual of CO2 offsetting principle]

At the end of this phase, **one round will be randomly selected for payment**. Your decision in that round will determine your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution of Phase 2. At the end of the experiment, your payoff will be exchanged into British pounds at a rate of 50 points = £1 and will be paid via Prolific. The carbon offsets will be donated to a real-world project via Gold Standard. More information about the Gold Standard-certified projects will be available at the end of this experiment.
If you are still unclear about the task, do not worry. The instructions are available throughout this phase. On the next page, you will see an example on how your payoff and the carbon offsets contribution are determined in a round. Then you will be asked to answer two questions to help comprehension.

**Example Calculation Page (Low Externality - Fig A.8):**

For example, if you decide to purchase **0/50/100 unit(s)** of the experimental product in a round:
according to:
`payoff = 100 points - 1 point * purchase amount + 2 points * purchase amount`
`carbon offsets contribution = 100 kg - 0.5 kg * purchase amount`
results of the example purchases will be:
| Purchase amount | Individual payoff | Carbon emissions | Carbon offsets that can be contributed |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0               | 100 points        | 0 kg             | 100 kg                               |
| 50              | 150 points        | 25 kg            | 75 kg                                |
| 100             | 200 points        | 50 kg            | 50 kg                                |

## Supplementary Methods 1: Expert interview materials and protocol


### Introduction to participants

We are interested in how people with different forms of expertise and professional experience think about and approach the topic of energy use in the home.

In the course of this interview, I will be asking you different types of questions to access your thinking about different facets of energy use in the home. The questions will be delivered and answered orally. The two mains tasks for this session are:

1.  A behavior choice task, where I will ask you to think through the relative energy costs or savings potential of various routine appliances and activities
2.  An estimation task, wherein you will provide an estimate of the energy consumed by various household appliances

After completing these tasks, I will ask that you share some reflections on the tasks and the ways that your experience and expertise informed your approaches. We will finish with a brief final set of questions about your background.

### Open-ended questions

1.  How much do you think about the amount of energy you use on a day-to-day basis?
2.  How does thinking about energy use factor into your professional life?
3.  What actions have you taken in the past to reduce your personal energy consumption?

### Talk-aloud protocol warm-up¹

We are interested in what you say to yourself as you perform the next task. I will ask you to talk aloud as you work on the problems. What I mean by talk aloud is that I want you to say out loud everything that you that you say yourself silently. Just act as if you are alone in the room, speaking to yourself. If you are silent for any length of time, I will remind you to keep talking aloud.

Before we turn to the main task, we will start with a couple of practice problems. I want you to talk aloud while you do these problems.

*   First, I want to ask you to add 82 and 18 in your head.
*   Next, I would like you to tell me how many windows are in your house.

### Choice task

### Estimation task

*\[These appliances will all appear on one page in a table format as shown below; correct values have been added in parentheses but were not included in the original document; presented to participants in paper form is interview is in person, presented online via Qualtrics if interview is remote]*

A standard incandescent light bulb uses about **100 units of energy** in one hour. When you are asked to estimate units of energy, please compare each appliance to this light bulb. Think about whether each appliance below uses **less energy or more energy** than this light bulb. Please use this number to help you make your estimates.

How many **units of energy** do you think each of the following devices typically consumes if used for **one hour**? Please provide you best estimates. Enter whole numbers with no other text (no decimals, ranges, or percentages).

## Supplementary Table 1: Choice task codebook

To extract the list of heuristics employed by experts during the choice task, the verbal reports made by the participants were transcribed and analyzed. The first layer of analysis entailed developing a coding scheme to categorize the content of the verbal reports. A codebook was developed to sort the information used by the experts into primary and secondary categories. Primary codes were developed for the three general content areas of the expert interviews: references to (1) observable cues about energy use, (2) device functions, and (3) device components. Each primary code was disaggregated into several secondary codes, each of which refers to a more detailed aspect of the primary code's general theme. For example, the *“Observable Cues”* primary code family contained eight secondary codes, including *“hot to touch,”* *“dims lights/trips circuits,”* and *“thick cord.”*

## Supplementary Table 2: Novice heuristics

The following set of 24 heuristics were collected by van den Broek and Walker (2019)². The accuracy of the heuristics in **bold** was evaluated in Survey 2.

1.  When the device can be set on a higher unit (e.g., higher temperature) the device uses more energy
2.  The more a device produces heat to heat up air or water or itself, the more energy it consumes
3.  The fast a device completes its task, the more energy the device consumes
4.  More active devices use more energy
5.  **Larger devices consume more energy**
6.  Knowledge about the energy consumption of the device that stems from public discourse or an unspecified sources
7.  Devices with similar functions consume same levels of energy while devices with different functions consume different levels of energy
8.  **Devices with a lot of components use more energy**
9.  **Devices use less energy in the utility phase compared to its use in a 'preparation phase'**
10. Devices that use a lot of Wattage consume more energy
11. Devices that reduce the temperature of an element such as air or water will consume high levels of energy
12. Devices that have previously cut out the fuse box consume a lot of energy
13. **Devices that have an initial heating up period consume more energy than devices that do not**
14. **Devices that have an energy label use more energy**
15. Devices that complete several tasks (either simultaneous or successive), or large tasks, consume more energy
16. **Devices that charge other devices use more energy**
17. Devices that carry out complex tasks consume more energy
18. Devices that are switched on for a longer period of time consume low levels of energy
19. Devices that are small but conduct a large task use a lot of energy
20. Devices that are more powerful use more energy
21. Devices that are less energy intense use less energy
22. **Devices that 'keep up the heat' or movement consume more energy**
23. Devices from some brands or certain type of devices are more energy consuming
24. **Appliances that are semantically related to each other consume similar levels of energy**

## Supplementary Analysis

### Power Analysis

Power analysis performed with *G\*Power* (v3.1; (3)) indicates that a sample size of 67 experts would have been suitable to detect correlations with medium effect sizes (r = 0.3) at 1 – β = 0.80. Given this study's sample of 30 experts, the effect size would have needed to be 0.45 or so to have a reasonable chance of detecting a significant correlation between the various measure of expert performance on the estimation task and experts' self-assessed relevance of their expertise (see Section 3.1).

### Correctness as a Function of Wattage Proximity

To test whether expert performance on the choice task was dependent on the magnitude of difference between devices, we examined the correlation between these two terms. Expert performance was measured in terms of the number of experts (out of 30) who correctly selected the appliance with the lowest energy use. Wattage difference was assessed by taking the logarithmic difference between the device with the second-lowest wattage and the device with the lowest wattage within each choice set (see Table S1 below). The correlation between expert performance and wattage difference (r = 0.14, p = 0.72) was small and non-significant, suggesting that expert choice performance was not dependent on the magnitude between choice wattages.
