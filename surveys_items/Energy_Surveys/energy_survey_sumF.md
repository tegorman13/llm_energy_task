### 2. Energy Consumed by the Average Household

Think about an average household in the United States.
Now think about the total amount of energy that is used directly by that household in one year.
Consider that the energy used by a household can be divided into household operations, transportation and food production.

*   Household operations include electricity, natural gas, and heating oil that is used for the house.
*   Transportation includes air travel, motor travel, and public transportation used by people in the household.
*   Food production includes growing and shipping food that people in the household eat.

> Please enter whole numbers with no other text (not decimals, ranges, or percent signs).

1.  What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by household operations? ____
2.  What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by transportation? ____
3.  What percentage of the total energy consumed per year by an average household in the United States is attributed to energy used by food production? ____

How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

> Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than turning off a 100-Watt bulb for one hour. Your best estimates are fine.

### 5. Energy Saved in Transportation

Assume that a 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour uses 100 units of energy in one hour.
(Note that this scale in different from that used in previous questions, in that "100 units" now refers to a different amount of energy.)

How many units of energy do you think each of the following changes will save?

> Enter a number less than 100 if you think the change saves less energy than is consumed by the 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Enter a number greater than 100 if you think the change saves more energy than consumed by the 20-miles-per-gallon car going 60 miles per hour. Your best estimates are fine.

### Definitions

> **Electric Vehicles** have an electric motor instead of a gasoline combustion engine. They use a large battery pack to store electricity and power the electric motor. Hybrid vehicles are not considered electric vehicles for the purposes of this survey.

> **Heat Pumps** are an electric alternative to furnaces and air conditioners. Heat pumps transfer heat rather than generating heat by burning fuel. During the winter, heat pumps warm your home by moving heat from outdoors to indoors. During the summer, heat pumps cool by moving heat from your house outdoors.

A **true** response indicates that the claims made in the statement are true.
A **false** response indicates that the claims made in the statement are false.
For each statement, we will then ask how confident you are in your answer on a slider scale which ranges from not at all confident to completely confident.
*While answering the following questions, please think about the United States specifically.*

### True/False Statements: Heat Pumps

> Recall that **heat pumps** are an electric alternative to furnaces and air conditioners. Heat pumps transfer heat rather than generating heat by burning fuel. During the winter, heat pumps warm your home by moving heat from outdoors to indoors. During the summer, heat pumps cool by moving heat from your house outdoors.

*(For each item below)*:
*   True / False
*   How confident are you in your answer? *(Slider scale: Not confident <---> Somewhat confident <---> Completely confident)*

1.  **HP_System:** Heat pumps can both heat and cool my home.
2.  **HP Practical:** Widespread adoption of heat pumps is practical today because we have enough electricity across all states to keep them powered.
3.  **HP Climate Change:** Heat pumps are better for the climate than traditional furnaces because they emit fewer greenhouse gases when in use.
4.  **HP Incentives:** With all the federal and state purchase incentives available for heat pumps, most owners typically spend less than $5,000 on purchase and installation.
5.  **HP List Price:** All central heat pump models sold in the United States costs more than $10,000 to buy and install.
6.  **HP maintenance:** Furnace and air-conditioner system require more frequent and extensive maintenance than heat pumps.
7.  **HP cold conditions:** Heat pumps do not require a backup heating system in subzero temperatures (below 0° Fahrenheit).
8.  **HP infrastructure integration:** Heat pumps cannot be integrated into existing systems and ductwork, making them incompatible with most homes.
9.  **HP Dealer:** Contractors are more likely to sell me a natural gas furnace than a heat pump system.
10. **HP efficiency:** Heat pumps use electricity to transfer heat which is more efficient than burning fossil fuels.
11. **HP Overseas:** Most of heat pump manufacturing takes place overseas.
12. **HP refrigerants:** Leaking refrigerants from heat pumps contribute more to climate change than fossil fuels used in furnaces.
13. **HP Workers:** The United States has more than enough trained workers to install heat pumps nationwide.
14. **HP Fuel:** Heat pumps end up being more expensive to run because electricity is more expensive than natural gas.
15. **HP lifespan:** Heat pumps do not last as long as a furnace system.
16. **HP supply chain delays:** People have to wait a long time to get parts to fix their heat pumps.
17. **HP Installation:** All heat pumps require the installation of a new and expensive electrical panel.

### True/False Statements: Electric Vehicles

> Recall that **electric vehicles** have an electric motor instead of a gasoline combustion engine. They use a large battery pack to store electricity and power the electric motor. Hybrid vehicles are not considered electric vehicles for the purposes of this survey.

*(For each item below)*:
*   True / False
*   How confident are you in your answer? *(Slider scale: Not confident <---> Somewhat confident <---> Completely confident)*

1.  **EV Electrical practicality:** Widespread adoption of electric vehicles is practical today because we have enough electricity across all states to keep them charged.
2.  **EV Time:** Even with the fastest charging technology, it takes several hours to charge an electric vehicle.
3.  **EV Public:** Four of every five electric vehicle owners are not able charge their cars when visiting a public charging station.
4.  **EV Climate:** Electric vehicles have a smaller carbon footprint than gasoline cars, even when accounting for the electricity used for charging.
5.  **EV Incentive:** With all of the federal and state purchase incentives available for electric vehicles, most consumers spend less on an electric vehicle than a comparable gasoline vehicle.
6.  **EV Maintain:** Gas-powered vehicles require more frequent and expensive maintenance than electric vehicles.
7.  **EV Cold:** An electric vehicle can drive as far as a gasoline car in freezing conditions.
8.  **EV Fuel:** Charging an electric vehicle from your home is equivalent in cost to purchasing gasoline for under $1.20 per gallon
9.  **EV Charging:** A significant barrier to electric vehicle adoption is lack of public charging stations.
10. **EV Range:** The driving range of an average electric vehicle is enough to meet the average long-distance road trip needs of typical Americans.
11. **EV Efficiency:** Electric vehicles use electricity more efficiently than gas powered cars use gasoline.
12. **EV Dealer:** Dealers are more likely to sell me a gas-powered vehicle than an electric vehicle.
13. **EV Fires:** Electric vehicles are more likely to catch fire than gasoline vehicles.
14. **EV Battery Recycling:** It is economically viable to recycle the whole battery of an electric vehicle.
15. **EV Overseas:** Globally, China makes most of the parts used in electric vehicles.
16. **EV List Price 40k:** All new electric vehicle models sold in the United States cost more than $40,000.
17. **EV Mining:** Electric vehicles are bad for the environment because of the mining practices required to build them.

### Supplementary Table 1: Choice Task Codebook
