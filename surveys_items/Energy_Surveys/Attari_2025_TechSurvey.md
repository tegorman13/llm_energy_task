# Technology Survey


## Definitions

To ensure clarity for the purposes of the survey please utilize the below definitions of electric vehicle and heat pump when answering survey questions.

> **Electric Vehicles** have an electric motor instead of a gasoline combustion engine. They use a large battery pack to store electricity and power the electric motor. Hybrid vehicles are not considered electric vehicles for the purposes of this survey.

> **Heat Pumps** are an electric alternative to furnaces and air conditioners. Heat pumps transfer heat rather than generating heat by burning fuel. During the winter, heat pumps warm your home by moving heat from outdoors to indoors. During the summer, heat pumps cool by moving heat from your house outdoors.
