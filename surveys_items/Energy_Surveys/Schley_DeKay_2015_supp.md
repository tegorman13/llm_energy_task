**Details regarding end-use categories and actual energy consumption**

Study 1 used the 13 nontransportation categories from Gardner and Stern's (2008) Table 1, which those authors based on data from the USEIA's (2007) Table A4. These 13 categories included all of those in our Fig. 1 (plus the "other" category), except for mass transportation, air travel, and private motor vehicles (see Table A.1). We followed Gardner and Stern in combining the USEIA's (2007) categories for clothes washers and clothes dryers; for refrigeration and freezers; and for space heating (home heating), furnace fans, and boiler circulation pumps. The energy mix in Study 1 included electricity, natural gas, heating oil, and propane. Studies 2 and 4 added the three transportation categories, which were also from Gardner and Stern's Table 1, and added gasoline and diesel fuel to the energy mix. Study 3 used a similar set of non-transportation categories from the USEIA's (2012) updated Table A4, but no transportation categories. The primary difference between the Study 3 home categories and those in Studies 1, 2, and 4 is that we did not divide the USEIA's "other" category into smaller categories for pool heaters, outdoor grills, and gas lamps (category 2 in our Fig. 1) and small electric appliances (category 9 in our Fig. 1), as Gardner and Stern had done. This procedure yielded 11 categories for Study 3, including "other." Study 3 removed gasoline and diesel fuel from the energy mix, but added wood and "other fuels." We also made minor changes to the names of some categories over the four studies (see Table A.1). For example, we used Gardner and Stern's (and the USEIA's) "space heating" category for the student participants in Study 1, but switched to "home heating" for all online participants, to reduce confusion.

*Footnotes from main text:*

[^1]: Replacing all 0% estimates with 0.2%, the smallest value for actual consumption among Gardner and Stern's (2008) end-use categories, yielded similar results in all analyses.
[^2]: These correlations do not appear to be limited by a restriction-of-range problem that could arise from "overly similar" end-use categories. The ratio of the untransformed percentage for the highest-use category (home heating or private motor vehicles) to that for the lowest-use category (dishwashers) was about 90, 190, and 50 in Studies 1-3, respectively. See the Appendix for the categories and percentages in each study.
[^3]: Excluding three items from the numeracy scale, because they might be considered less related to the skills required in the primary energy-estimation task, lowered the reliability of the scale (Cronbach's α = 0.53, 0.54, and 0.51 for Studies 1-3, respectively), but yielded roughly similar regression results. With the five-item numeracy scale, the coefficients for the two numeracy interactions were larger in Studies 1 and 2 and slightly smaller (and not significant) in Study 3. All 95% CIs were wider, as might be expected for a less reliable scale. See Table S.1 in the Supplementary Materials.
[^4]: As before, excluding three items from the numeracy scale lowered the reliability of the scale (Cronbach's α = 0.66), but yielded roughly similar regression results. With the five-item scale, the coefficient for the Numeracy × Actual Consumption interaction was larger (0.026 instead of 0.020), but no longer significant, p = 0.060, because the 95% CI was wider than before. See Table S.2 in the Supplementary Materials. Across all four studies, any benefit of restricting the numeracy scale by eliminating items that might be considered less related to the primary energy-estimation task was offset by the increased error in the shorter measure.

## Supplementary Materials for "Cognitive Accessibility in Judgments of Household Energy Consumption"

Dan R. Schley and Michael L. DeKay

The following two tables correspond to Tables 1 and 2 in the main text. However, in place of the full eight-item numeracy scale from Weller, Dieckmann, Tusler, Mertz, and Peters (2013), the analyses for these tables used a five-item scale that excluded three items that might be considered less related to the skills required by our primary energy-estimation task. The excluded items were one longer item requiring the interpretation of a frequency table and two items originally intended to assess cognitive reflection (Frederick, 2005). Excluding these items lowered the reliability of the scale.

Note. These analyses used the shorter five-item numeracy scale that excluded three items. The intercepts and the main effects of numeracy are not reported because they reflect variation in estimates for the omitted "other" category only. Study 1 used 13 categories, Study 2 used 16 categories, and Study 3 used 11 categories. See the Appendix for category details.
ªIn Study 3, we assessed accessibility on a nine-point scale rather than a five-point scale. For comparability across studies, we linearly rescaled those responses prior to analysis.

The materials for all four surveys are presented below. These were computer surveys, so the materials here do not look exactly like they did in the actual experiments.

### STUDY 1

Welcome to the Household Energy Survey. Please answer the questions to the best of your ability, without looking up any answers online. Please press the ">>" button to begin the survey.

Please consider the total amount of energy (electricity, natural gas, propane, or heating oil) used by typical American households in a given year. Please indicate what percentage of total energy you think is used by devices or appliances in that category for typical American households. Each time you type a number into a box, the bottom box "Total" will adjust to let you know how many percentage points you have used. You can change any of your answers until you are satisfied. You are not expected to know the exact answers, but give your best estimate. After you have assigned all 100 percentage points, and you are content with your answers, please press the ">>" button.

6. Suppose you have a close friend who has a lump in her breast and must have a mammogram. Of 100 women like her, 10 of them actually have a malignant tumor and 90 of them do not. Of the 10 women who actually have a tumor, the mammogram indicates correctly that 9 of them have a tumor and indicates incorrectly that 1 of them does not have a tumor. Of the 90 women who do not have a tumor, the mammogram indicates correctly that 81 of them do not have a tumor and indicates incorrectly that 9 of them do have a tumor. The table below summarizes all of this information. Imagine that your friend tests positive (as if she had a tumor), what is the likelihood that she actually has a tumor?

|                     | Tested Positive | Tested Negative | Totals |
| :------------------ | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----: |
| Actually has a tumor|        9        |        1        |   10   |

Welcome to the Household Energy Survey. Please answer the questions to the best of your ability, without looking up any answers online. Please press the ">>" button to begin the survey.

Please consider the total amount of energy (electricity, natural gas, heating oil, propane, wood, and other fuels) used by ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN THE UNITED STATES in a given year. Please consider only energy that is used at households (houses, apartments, condominiums, etc.), not energy that is used elsewhere. In particular, you may ignore any additional energy that is used in the production of energy for U.S. households and the delivery of energy to U.S. households. Please indicate what percentage of total household energy you think is used by devices or appliances in each of the categories below. Each time you type a number into a box, the bottom box "Total" will adjust to let you know how many percentage points you have used. You can change any of your answers until you are satisfied. You are not expected to know the exact answers, but please give your best estimates. After you have assigned all 100 percentage points, and you are content with your answers, please press the ">>" button.
